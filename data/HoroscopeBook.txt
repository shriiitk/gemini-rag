Preface to the Revised and Enlarged Edition


Since the publication of this small manual of practical Astrology,
two editions of which have been exhausted, the attention given to the
subject has so far extended as to create an increased demand for a
concise work of this nature, designed for the initial use of students
and offered at a price that is within the means of all. It is believed
that the revision and enlargement of the present work will render it
even more popular than hitherto with beginners.

The practical uses of Astrology are daily more and more recognized and
appreciated, and although some of the higher and later developments
of Astrology in its relation to every-day problems have necessarily
been withheld from these pages, yet it is to be hoped that so much as
is here presented of an abstruse and recondite science will enable
the student to pursue the subject with increasing assurance and
satisfaction, in which case doubtless he will readily discover for
himself, and without any special pointing on my part, that Astrology is
primarily and finally a practical and useful study.

There are, of course, many aspects of this fascinating subject which
find no place in this small work, which deals solely with Genethliacal
Astrology, or the doctrine of Nativities. Yet if it be true, as I
think to be the case, that "the proper study for mankind is man,"
then undoubtedly we are right in selecting this phase of Astrological
Science as that to which the student should first devote himself.

When we have thoroughly arrived at an understanding of the complex
nature of human character and the primary causes of variety in
expression, when we have seen for ourselves how the many-coloured dome
of Life overarches us of this sublunary world with its kaleidoscopic
interplay of forces, we shall be to some extent better equipped not
only to deal with character as we find it, but also to direct the
forces of the human mind along channels which lead to the preservation
of our social economy, and that not by any restrictive measures or
harmful suppression of natural passions and powers, but by conversion
of them into forms that are conservative and useful.

To apply oneself to the specialization of inherent faculty, to find
the line of least resistance, and to discover the measure of one's own
soul in the universe and the limit to which ambition can safely aspire,
these are things necessary to be known and things that Astrology makes
clear to the mind in the very earliest stages of our study.

And apart from the scientific verities to which the science of
planetary influence directs us, there are other not less important
and fascinating truths of a purely philosophic nature to which it
inevitably impels the mind and which cannot fail to exercise a
tremendous influence in the shaping of our thought in regard to the
purpose of life. It places the thoughtful student in an entirely new
position with regard to many of the deeper problems of existence, and
it is certainly the fact that to those who newly come to its study,
Astrology is a revelation, an enlightenment, and a conviction from
which there is no possible or desirable escape.

Introduction


From the earliest ages of the world's history the subject of Astrology
has excited the interest of, and exercised a great influence over,
the minds of a certain order of thinking men. The science has never
been universal in its acceptance, though it is safe to say that, with
its countless adherents in the East and the ever-increasing number
of its advocates in the West, there is no faith which has a more
universal application than the belief in the influence of the heavenly
bodies over the destinies of human beings. It is not possible within
the limits of a small handbook such as this to adequately consider
the philosophic paradox which makes of Freewill in man a "necessity
in play"; but it is obvious that the concept is not altogether
unscientific, seeing that it is customary to speak of the "free path of
vibration" in chemical atoms while at the same time it is known that
these atoms have their restricted characteristics, modes of motion,
&c., and are all subject to the general laws controlling the bodies
of which they form integral parts. Let it suffice that if we can
trace an actual connectedness between the disposition of the heavenly
bodies at the moment of a birth and the known life and character of
the individual then born, and an exact correspondence between the
course of events in that life with the changes occurring in the heavens
subsequent to the moment of birth, we shall do well to accept the fact
for what it is worth, and arrange our philosophic notions accordingly.

As far back as the year B.C. 2154, we find mention of the great
importance attaching to the celestial phenomena in the minds of Chinese
rulers. It is recorded in the Historical Classic of China that at
that time the astrologers Hi and Ho neglected their duties so that
when, on the 10th of October, there was a great eclipse of the Sun
at Peking between seven and nine o'clock in the morning, the people
were wholly unprepared for it, and "ran about here and there in the
utmost consternation." For this offence Hi and Ho were deprived of
their offices, their estates were confiscated and they were driven from
the kingdom. Among the Hindus we have the classical writers Garga,
Parashara, and Mihira, together with their legions of commentators.
The Assyrian records are full of astrological allusions regarding the
influence of planetary conjunctions and stellar positions. The Greek
mythology is nothing but a vast system of cosmographical astrology,
and there is no other history in it than what you may read in the
constellations of the heavens and the corresponding evolution of the
human race. Aristotle made it a part of his philosophy. Hipparchus,
Hippocrates, Thales, Galenius, and others subscribed an intelligent
belief in its principles. To Claudius Ptolemy, however, we are indebted
for the first concise and scientific statement of its principles and
practice, so far as Europe is concerned. He wrote the Tetrabiblos, or
Four Books, and laid the foundations of a true astrological science.
Julius Firmicus confirmed Ptolemy and enlarged upon his observations.
The subsequent discovery of the planets Uranus and Neptune by Herschel
and Adams, widened the field of research and gave to later astrologers
the clue to much that hitherto had been imperfectly understood. Not
that these discoveries overturned the whole system of astrology, as
some have imagined and foolishly stated, or that they negatived the
conclusions drawn from the observed effects of the seven anciently
known bodies of the solar system, but it became possible after a
lapse of time to fill in the blank spaces and to account for certain
events which had not been traced to the action of any of the already
known planets. The discovery of argon did not destroy our conclusions
regarding the nature and characteristics of oxygen or hydrogen or
nitrogen, nor give an entirely new meaning to the word "atmosphere."
If even so many as seven new planets should be discovered, there would
yet not be a single paragraph of this book which would need revising.
What is known regarding planetary action in human life is known with
great certainty, and the effects of one planet can never be confounded
with those of another. Incomplete as it must needs be, it is yet a
veritable science both as to its principles and practice. It claims
for itself a place among the sciences for the sole reason that it is
capable of mathematical demonstration, and deals only with the observed
positions and motions of the heavenly bodies; and the man who holds
to the principia of Newton, the solidarity of the solar system, the
interaction of the planetary bodies and their consequent electrostatic
effects upon the Earth, cannot, while subject to the air he breathes,
deny the foundation principles of astrology. The application of
these principles to the facts of everyday life is solely a matter of
prolonged research and tabulation upon an elaborate scale which has
been going on for thousands of years in all parts of the world, so
that all the reader has to do is to make his own horoscope and put
the science to the test of true or false. The present writer is in a
position to know that the study of astrology at the present day is no
less sincere than widely spread, but few care to let their studies be
known, for, as Prof. F. Max Müller recently said, "So great is the
ignorance which confounds a science requiring the highest education,
with that of the ordinary gipsy fortune-teller." That to which the
great Kepler was compelled "by his unfailing experience of the course
of events in harmony with the changes taking place in the heavens,"
to subscribe "an unwilling belief," the science which was practised
and advocated by Tycho Brahe under all assaults of fortune and adverse
opinion, the art that arrested the attention of the young Newton
and set him pondering upon the problems of force and matter, which
fascinated the minds of such men as Francis Bacon, Archbishop Usher,
Haley, Sir George Witchell, Flamstead, and a host of others, is to-day
the favourite theme of thousands of intelligent minds and bids fair to
become a subject of popular inquiry.

It is believed that the present work will be of considerable assistance
to those who seriously contemplate an initial study of the science of
horoscopy, and although it by no means exhausts what is known on the
subject, yet it will be found accurate and reliable as far as it goes,
and will enable any one of ordinary intelligence to test the claims of
Astrology for himself. This is as much as can be expected in the limits
of a small handbook. The literature of the subject is considerable, and
the present writer only takes credit to himself so far as his own wide
experience and practice have enabled him to present the subject in a
simple and brief manner.

CHAPTER I

THE PLANETS, THEIR NATURES AND TYPES


The luminaries and planets are known to astronomers under the following
names and symbols:--

The Sun [symbol: Sun], Moon [symbol: Moon], Neptune [symbol: Neptune],
Uranus [symbol: Uranus], Saturn [symbol: Saturn], Jupiter [symbol:
Jupiter], Mars [symbol: Mars], Venus [symbol: Venus], and Mercury
[symbol: Mercury].

Neptune revolves around the Sun in its distant orbit once in about
165 years. Uranus completes its orbital revolution in 84 years,
Jupiter in 12 years, Mars in about 15 months, Venus in 11 months, and
Mercury in 18 weeks. If you imagine these bodies to be revolving in a
plane around the Sun and yourself to be standing within the Sun, the
motions of these bodies will appear almost uniform and always in one
direction. Were the orbits of the planets circular and the Sun holding
the centre of the circle, their motions would be constant, that is to
say, always in the same direction and at the same rate. But the orbits
are elliptical, and the Sun holds a position in one of the foci of
each ellipse. Consequently the planets are at times further from the
Sun than at others, and they are then said to be in their aphelion,
the opposite point of the orbit where they are nearest to the Sun
being called the perihelion. When at aphelion the planets move slower,
and when at perihelion they move quicker than at the mean distance.
Astronomers employ an imaginary circular orbit for the planets, in
which they move at an uniform rate of velocity, which is called the
mean motion. This is subject to an equation depending on the position
of the planet in its orbit, and it determines the difference between
the imaginary planet and the true planet. The equation itself depends
on the eccentricity of the orbit, that is to say, its relation to a
circle drawn around the same focal centre. The Earth follows the same
laws as all other bodies of the same system.

But if we imagine the Earth to be stationary in space and the centre
around which the planets revolve, their motions present several
irregularities. Mercury and Venus will then appear to revolve around
the Sun while the Sun revolves around the Earth, sometimes being
between the Earth and the Sun, which is called an Inferior conjunction,
sometimes on the further side of the Sun away from the Earth, as at
their Superior conjunction; and again, at other times to the right
or left of the Sun, in East or West elongation. The other planets,
having orbits greater than that of the Earth, will appear to revolve
around it at constantly varying distances and velocities. At certain
points in their orbits they will appear to remain stationary in the
same part of the Zodiac. The annexed illustration will assist the lay
reader perhaps. The body M is Mercury when at Inferior conjunction with
the Sun, as seen from the Earth. The letter V is the planet Venus at
Superior conjunction with the Sun. The points W and E are the points of
greatest elongation West and East, and the letter S shows the points
in the orbit at which those bodies appear to be stationary when viewed
from the Earth, at G. As seen from the Earth, Venus would appear to be
direct and Mercury retrograde.

[Illustration]

Astrologically we regard the Earth as the passive subject of planetary
influence, and we have therefore to regard it as the centre of the
field of activity. If we were making a horoscope for an inhabitant of
the planet Mars, we should make Mars the centre of the system. The
planets' positions are therefore taken as from the centre of the Earth
(Geocentric), and not as from the centre of the Sun (Heliocentric). An
astrological Ephemeris of the planets' motions is employed for this
purpose (see Sect. II., chap, i.), and there are 480,000 of these sold
to astrologers or students of astrology every year, from which fact it
is possible to draw one's own conclusions as to the state of Astrology
in the West. These figures, of course, do not include the millions
of almanac readers nor the Oriental students, who prepare their own
ephemerides.

Knowing the simple natures of the several planets we are able to arrive
at an estimate of their effects when acting in combination.

_Neptune_ acts upon the mind of man to produce a highly-strung nervous
temperament, often allied to either insanity or genius; neurosis,
aphasia, &c. It produces complications in business and an involved
state of affairs generally. Disposes to fraud, double-dealing, and
irresponsible actions. In the body it produces waste of tissue and a
consumptive habit.

_Uranus_ gives an eccentric mind, waywardness, originality,
inventiveness. Acting on the affairs of business, it produces sudden
and unexpected developments, irregularities, rapid rise and fall,
instability, unexpected turns of good and bad fortune. In the body
it has relation to the nervous system, and its diseases are those of
paralysis, lesion, and nervous derangement.

_Saturn_ produces a thoughtful, sober, ponderable mind; steadfastness,
patience, and endurance; disposition to routine and habit, method. In
financial affairs it gives steady results commensurate with labour,
success that is slow but sure, durance, hardships, privations. In the
body it is related to the osseous system, and its effects are brought
about by obstructions, chills, and inhibition of function.

_Jupiter_ gives joviality, optimism, bountifulness, generosity, a rich
and fruitful mind. It renders the subject fortunate in his affairs,
giving success and frequently opulence. With this planet strong in the
horoscope a person never "goes under." In the body it has relation
to the arterial process, and its diseases are those which arise from
surfeit, congestion, and plethora.

_Mars_ confers a sense of freedom, much ambition and executive ability,
frankness, truthfulness, and scorn of consequence. It renders the mind
forceful and militant, stimulates to new projects and enterprises, and
in the body of man has relation to the muscular system. Its diseases
are those which arise from inflammatory action in the tissues.

_Venus_ confers poesy, good taste, fine feeling, artistic powers,
gentleness, docility, dalliance, and love of pleasure. It renders the
affairs pleasant and prosperous, giving profit from both artistic and
rustic pursuits. Next to Jupiter it is the most benefic of the planets
in its action on mankind. In the body it has relation to the venous
system, and its diseases are those which arise from impurities of the
blood, scorbutic and zymotic diseases, eczema, smallpox, measles, &c.

_Mercury_ renders its subjects active, versatile, apt and
business-like, disposed to much commerce, whether of the mind or
the market, and eager in the pursuit of knowledge; alert, and
well-informed. Its influence on affairs of life is variable, for it
always translates the nature of that planet to which at birth it is in
nearest aspect (Sect. I., chap. iv.). In the body it is related to the
sensorium, the centres of sensation, and reflexly controls the nerves
of action.

_The Moon_ gives gracefulness of manner and suavity of speech, softness
and adaptability of nature, variableness, love of change, romance,
and adventure; disposed to exploration and voyaging. In the body
it corresponds to the glandular system, and its diseases are those
incidental to the lymphatic glands and vascular tissue.

_The Sun_ renders its subjects magnanimous, noble, proud, despising all
mean and sordid actions; loyal, truthful, and fearless. It produces
honours and the favour of dignitaries, and renders the subject
fortunate in the control of his affairs. In the body it controls the
vital principle.

The types of persons produced by the various planets are very distinct,
the chief features of each being as follows:--

_Neptune_--Thin, nervous-looking people, blue eyes, soft, silky hair,
thin and usually long faces, frequently wearing a strained or startled
look. _Uranus_--Tall, wiry, and energetic figures, alert, muscular,
spasmodic, and with some touch of eccentricity. _Saturn_--Dark and
lean people, small, deep-set eyes, heavy brows, long noses, thin lips,
and sallow complexions. _Jupiter_--Full bodied, robust men, large and
expressive blue or brown eyes, arched brows, high foreheads, oval
faces, and rich brown hair. _Mars_--Strong, muscular, and athletic
bodies, ruddy complexion, grey eyes, prominent brows, sloping forehead,
and usually some mark or scar in the face. _Sun_--Fresh, clear
complexion, blue or grey eyes, round head, broad shoulders, strong
jaws, upright and dignified carriage. _Venus_--Elegant, well-groomed,
and often dainty-looking people, with blue or soft brown eyes, brown
hair, fine teeth and finger-nails, small feet and short fleshy hands.
_Mercury_--Thin, tall, and active bodies, alert appearance, small
and usually dark eyes; wide, thin lips, long arms and slender hands.
Frequently great talkers and quick walkers. _Moon_--Rather short and
fleshy people, with pale face, soft limpid eyes, sad brown or medium
coloured hair, fine teeth, broad chest, and a tendency to a squat
fulness of body. The forehead is usually high and broad.

Look at the people as they pass you in the street. Bring them if
possible under one or other of these types. Consider what has been said
of the planets' natures, and you have a ready key to something of their
character and destiny.




CHAPTER II

THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC


The Zodiac is an imaginary belt of the Heavens through which the Sun and
planets move in their apparent revolutions round the Earth. It extends
from 23° 27´ above the plane of the Equator to the same distance below
it, being bounded by the Tropic of Cancer on the North and by that of
Capricorn on the South. The Ecliptic is a circle transecting this belt
at an angle of 23° 27´ to the plane of the Equator. The points where it
cuts the Equator are called the Equinoxes.

The Ecliptic is divided into twelve equal sections, counting from the
Vernal Equinox. These are called the Signs of the Zodiac. Each sign
occupies 30 degrees of the circle.

Their names and symbols are as follows:--

    1. Aries, the Ram [symbol: Aries]
    2. Taurus, the Bull [symbol: Taurus]
    3. Gemini, the Twins [symbol: Gemini]
    4. Cancer, the Crab [symbol: Cancer]

For Astrological purposes they are grouped according to the element and
the constitution which they represent, thus:--


ELEMENTS.

    Fire--Aries, Leo, Sagittarius.
    Earth--Taurus, Virgo, Capricornus.
    Air--Gemini, Libra, Aquarius.
    Water--Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces.


CONSTITUTIONS.

    Movable--Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricornus.
    Fixed--Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius.
    Flexed--Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces.

Every alternate sign, beginning with Aries, is male and the rest are
female. Aries, male; Taurus, female; Gemini, male; Cancer, female, &c.
The signs Aries, Leo, Capricornus are called barren, while Taurus,
Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces are fruitful. Aries governs the East,
Cancer the North, Libra the West, and Capricornus the South.

The Double-bodied signs are Gemini, Sagittarius, and Pisces. It is
important that all these classifications should be learned, as they
form an essential part of the doctrine of Astrology, and are frequently
employed in the reading of a Horoscope.

The types of people under the various signs should also be known as
intimately as possible. A person is said to be "under" a sign--that is
to say, under its influence, when that sign is rising in the East at
the moment of birth. You will recognise these types among your friends
and associates:--

_Aries_ produces a person of lean body, long neck, high cheek-bones,
grey eyes, sandy or sad brown hair, which is either wiry and straight
or crisp and curling. The front teeth are usually large and prominent.

_Taurus_ gives a full, thick-set body, strong neck and shoulders, full
brown eyes, dark curling hair, full lips, rather wide mouth, and round,
bullet-shaped head. The hands and feet are short and fleshy.

_Gemini_ produces a tall, active, and upright body, long arms and legs,
wide, thin lips, straight and often _retroussé_ nose, lank, straight
black hair, rather wide shoulders, and thin body.

_Cancer_ denotes a rather short, squat figure, full lymphatic body,
pale complexion, round face, broad forehead, sad brown hair, large
aqueous eyes, full chest, short, fleshy hands and feet.

_Leo_ renders its subjects tall, broad shouldered, fine and manly
figures, small round head, fair complexion, blue or grey eyes, flaxen
or fair brown hair, upright and fearless carriage.

_Virgo_ renders the body thin and active, the head well developed, the
forehead broad, hair light brown and waving off the forehead, eyes
blue, shoulders broad, the type being of an intellectual or artistic
form.

_Libra_ gives an elegant body, well-developed limbs, fine oval face,
straight nose, fine blue eyes (sometimes deep brown), flaxen or
chestnut hair, beautiful complexion. The highest types of beauty are to
be found under this sign.

_Scorpio_ gives a short, thick-set, and powerful figure, broad, deep
chest, dusky or sallow complexion, dark curling or crisp hair, strong
and rather bowed legs. This is a very virile and robust type.

_Sagittarius_ gives a tall person, well-made figure, elegant limbs,
oval and rather long face, brown or chestnut hair growing off the
forehead, fine expressive eyes, rather prominent and of a dark brown or
blue colour, long nose, slightly aquiline.

_Capricornus_ produces a slight and rather ill-formed person, long and
scraggy neck, prominent features, narrow chin, weak and frequently
decrepit limbs, weak chest and sloping shoulders. Frequently the figure
is wiry and suggestive of considerable powers of endurance. The brows
are prominent, the nose long, and the face thin and hard-set.

_Aquarius_ contributes the finest types of beauty next to Libra.
The Saxon type is dominant. A tall figure, well formed and rounded,
fair complexion and blue eyes, flaxen hair, straight features,
well-developed chin, and fine, clear forehead.

_Pisces_ produces one of rather short stature, short limbs, lymphatic
body, pale complexion, limpid blue eyes, black or brown eyes, short
nose, full lips, round face, small hands and feet.

The short signs are Taurus, Cancer, Capricornus, and Pisces. The tall
signs are Gemini, Leo, Sagittarius, and Aquarius. The others are of
medium height.

The planets rising in each sign will always alter the type by
impressing their own characteristics on the subject.

Each sign has a Ruler, and the position of the ruler of the rising sign
has much to do with the physical conformation, as if Taurus be rising
and Venus, its ruler, be in Leo, the person will be taller and fairer
than indicated by Taurus alone. Pure types are very uncommon.

The rulership of the planets in the signs is as follows:--

    Saturn governs Aquarius and Capricornus.
    Jupiter governs Pisces and Sagittarius.
    Mars governs Aries and Scorpio.
    Venus governs Taurus and Libra.
    Mercury governs Gemini and Virgo.
    The Moon governs Cancer, and Leo is governed by the Sun.

When a planet is found in a sign over which it is said to govern it
acts more strongly than usual, and when in the opposite signs to those
it governs it is said to be in its "fall," when it is weaker than usual.

Planets governing opposite signs to one another are said to be
"enemies." Such do not produce harmonious and favourable results when
acting in conjunction.




CHAPTER III

THE CELESTIAL HOUSES


The imaginary circle which passes immediately over your head as you
face the South is called the Prime Vertical. This is divided for
astrological purposes into twelve equal divisions called Houses, six of
which are above the horizon and six below it. They are counted from the
East Horizon under the Earth to the West, and thence through the zenith
to the East again. The figure in Section IV., chapter v., will make the
idea easy of comprehension.

Each such division or House carries its own signification, and it has
been ascertained beyond all doubt or cavil that the ruling of the
Ancients in this matter is altogether reliable, however empirical it
may appear.

The First House governs the personal appearance, but chiefly the
face and head. The Second House rules over finance, movable effects,
commerce. In the body it governs the neck and throat. The Third House
governs short journeys, letters, and other means of communication, near
relations or neighbours. In the body it governs the arms and lungs.
The Fourth House governs real estate, the residence, the produce of
the earth, the mother of the subject, and the end of life. In the
body, the breasts and thorax. The Fifth House governs progeny, the
sex instincts, domestic relations, and social pleasures. In the body,
the back and heart. The Sixth House governs the health, servants, and
personal comforts of the subject, clothes, food, and other physical
requisites, sanitation, hygiene. In the body it rules over the abdomen
and lower viscera. The Seventh House has dominion over marriage,
contracts, agreements, partners, and matters of exchange. In the body
it has relation to the loins and kidneys. The Eighth House rules death,
loss, legacies and dowries, and matters appertaining to the deceased.
In the body it is related to the excretory system. The Ninth House
is said to govern long journeys, publications, religious beliefs,
foreign lands, and legal affairs. In the body it rules the thighs.
The Tenth House rules over position, honour and fame of the subject,
the father, superiors of all orders. In the body it rules over the
knees. The Eleventh House governs friends, social relations, societies
and companies with which the subject is concerned. In the body it
has relation to the legs from calf to ankle. The Twelfth House rules
ambushes, restraints, privations, imprisonments, confinements, and all
limitations of the personal freedom. In the body it rules the ankles
and feet.

Applying these significations to the interpretation of a horoscope it
will be seen that if Mars should be rising at the moment of birth there
will be a scar or mark on the face. Observations of this sort will
frequently assist to determine the time of birth when it is not known.
Similarly with other planets in the same or other Houses; but of this
more anon.




CHAPTER IV

THE ASTRONOMICAL ASPECTS


Aspects are certain angular distances measured on the Ecliptic, and
they form a fundamental part of astrological science. Any planet may
be good or bad in its effects on the character and destiny, according
to the aspect that it throws to the chief points of the Horoscope.
The aspects are: The semisquare aspect of 45 degrees, sextile of 60
degrees, square of 90 degrees, trine of 120 degrees, sesquiquadrate
of 135 degrees, and the opposition of 180 degrees. There is also the
conjunction, when bodies are in the same degree or part of a Sign.

The good aspects are the trine and sextile; the evil being the
semisquare, square, sesquiquadrate, and opposition. The aspect of
a planet determines its effects, whether for good or evil. The
conjunction is good with good planets, such as Jupiter and Venus, and
evil with malefic planets such as Mars and Saturn.

When planets are the same distance North or South of the Equator
they are in parallel declination (p.d.), and they then act as if in
conjunction. Also when planets are in mutual disposition, that is
to say, occupying one another's signs, they act as if they were in
conjunction.

Planets in conjunction act according to their simple natures, but when
in aspect, according to the nature of that aspect. The benefic planets
Jupiter, Venus, Sun, Moon, and also Mercury when in good disposition
with another planet or in a congenial Sign, produce good effects by
their conjunctions and by their trine and sextile aspects; but when
in square, semisquare, or sesquisquare aspect they are uniformly evil
in effect. On the other hand, the malefic planets Neptune, Uranus,
Saturn, and Mars, together with Mercury when ill-disposed or in
uncongenial Signs, are evil in their effects when in conjunction with
the significant points of the horoscope; also when in evil aspect; but
they nevertheless produce good effects when in good aspect.


The Significators.

The more important points of the Horoscope to which aspect can be
thrown are called "Significators." The general significators in any
horoscope are the Sun, the Moon, the Midheaven (the degree which holds
the meridian of the horoscope), and the Ascendant (the degree which is
rising). But every planet can be a particular significator in its own
province, namely, in the Sign which it rules, and the House in which it
is found at birth.

In a general sense the Moon is significant of the mother, female
relations, the personal health and fortunes and the changes incident to
these. The Sun in the same way indicates the father, male relations,
the vital principle, and position. Mercury is the significator of the
mind and intellect, the faculties generally. Venus is significatrix
of love affairs, domestic relations, pleasures, and of young female
relations, sisters, &c. Mars is significator of enterprises, strifes,
and young male relations. Jupiter is significator of increase and
emoluments; Saturn of legacies, inheritance, and aged persons; Uranus
of civic and governmental bodies; Neptune of voyages and psychic
experiences. The chief points to be regarded, however, are the
Midheaven, the Ascendant, and the places of the Sun and Moon.




SECTION II

THE CONSTRUCTION OF A HOROSCOPE




CHAPTER I

THE EPHEMERIS AND ITS USES


An Ephemeris is an almanac of the planetary positions day by day
throughout any given year. They are to be obtained at a cost of one
shilling per year, in a convenient form specially adapted to the use of
astrologers. In the first column will be found the Sidereal Time for
the day, which is the Sun's Right Ascension or distance from the Vernal
Equinox, expressed in Hours, Minutes, and Seconds, and equated to Mean
Time at Greenwich. By merely adding the time after noon, or subtracting
the hours and minutes before noon, at which the birth took place, you
will obtain the Right Ascension of the Midheaven at the moment of
birth. The use to which this is put will appear in the next chapter.
It corresponds to a particular degree of the Zodiac which is in the
Midheaven at the given time of birth.

The next column contains the Sun's longitude at Noon for each day. By
taking the position on one day from that on the next day, the motion
of the Sun for 24 hours is obtained, and a proportion of this for the
hour of birth can easily be made. The mean motion of the Sun per day
is 2-1/2´, or 1 degree per day. In another column will be found the
Moon's longitude, and in adjacent columns its declination and latitude.
Declination is distance North or South of the Equator, and celestial
latitude is distance North or South of the Ecliptic. The longitudes of
the other bodies are also given for each day at noon.

The mean longitudinal progress of the several bodies is as follows:
Sun, 2-1/2´ per hour, or 1 degree per day; Moon, 32´ per hour, or 13
degrees per day; Neptune, 2´ per day; Uranus, 3´ per day; Saturn,
about 5´ per day; Jupiter, about 12´ per day; Mars, 45´ per day, or
about 2´ per hour; Venus, 72´ per day, or 3´ per hour; Mercury, 84´
per day, or 3-1/2´ per hour. These increments are for direct motion
only; the planets are, as already explained, sometimes retrograde and
sometimes stationary. The Horoscope of birth is only concerned with the
longitudes of the planets, but when one or more planets have the same
declination North or South, they should be noted as being in Parallel,
for they then act as if they were in conjunction.

Take in hand, then, the Ephemeris for the year of your birth and read
this chapter with it in view. After understanding its construction,
extract the Sidereal Time at Noon for the day of your birth and refer
to the next chapter.




CHAPTER II

TO ERECT A FIGURE OF THE HEAVENS


Take the Sidereal time at noon on the day of birth, and add to it the
hours and minutes after noon at which you were born, or if before noon,
subtract from it the interval between the birth and noon. This will
give the approximate Right Ascension of the Midheaven at birth. Thus,
suppose a person to be born on May 1, 1890, at 3h. 30m. p.m. in London--

    The Sidereal time, noon, May 1, 1890, is      2h.  36m.  28s.
    To which add time p.m.                        3    30     0
    Acceleration at 10´´ per hour                 0     0    34
                                                  ---------------
    Right Ascension of Midheaven at Birth         6h.   7m.   2s.

With this Right Ascension of the Midheaven you then refer to Tables
of Houses for London (see Chapter III.), and against this quantity of
Sidereal Time you will find, under the column marked 10, the sign and
degree which corresponds to it, namely, the 2nd of Cancer. This is put
at the head of the figure, and the rest of the signs are placed around
the figure in their order as shown in the Table. Only six of the Houses
are given in the Tables, because the opposite Houses will have the
_same_ degrees of the _opposite_ signs on them. Thus we read against
the Right Ascension 6h. 7m. 28s. the following:--

       10       11      12      Ascen.        2         3
    Cancer 2, Leo 8, Virgo 8, Libra 1.33, Libra 26, Scorp. 26.

This means that the 2nd degree of Cancer was on the cusp of the Tenth
House (the Midheaven) at the moment of the birth, Leo 8th on the cusp
of the Eleventh House, Virgo 8th on the cusp of the Twelfth, Libra 1.33
on the Ascendant or Eastern Horizon, and so of the rest. On the cusp
of the Fourth House we place Capricornus 2, because the Fourth House
is opposite the 10th and the sign Capricornus is opposite to Cancer.
On the cusp of the Fifth House we place Aquarius 8, because the Fifth
House is opposite to the Eleventh, and Aquarius is opposite to Leo.
When completed we find the cusps of the Houses as follows, opposite to
those in the Tables:--

        4          5         6          7          8        9
    Capric. 2, Aquar. 8, Pisces 8, Aries 1.33, Aries 26, Taur. 26.

It is then only necessary to place the planets in the figure, as
explained in the preceding chapter, and the figure of the Heavens is
complete.


To Draw a Figure of the Heavens.

Take a pair of compasses, and with a radius, of about 2-1/2 inches,
describe a circle. Within this, and with a radius of about 2 inches,
describe another. With the radius of this latter mark off six equal
divisions, and then equally divide these so as to make twelve. Within
the figure draw a small circle, concentric with the others, to
represent the Earth. From the points of division already obtained draw
straight lines to the centre of the figure until they touch the circle
of the Earth. You then have a figure which represents the Houses of the
Heavens, being a twelvefold division of the Prime Vertical. The lines
extending from the outer circles to the Earth are the cusps of the
Houses (see fig. Section IV., chap. 5).

The degrees of the Zodiac which are upon the cusps of the Houses,
as found in the Tables opposite a given Sidereal Time, are written
over the several cusps in their order between the two outer circles.
Reference to the Ephemeris for May 1, 1890, shows the Sun at noon in
Taurus 11 degrees 2 minutes. Three and a half hours later it will have
advanced about 8 minutes in longitude, so that its position will be in
Taurus 11 degrees 10 minutes. This longitude falls in the Eighth House,
and we therefore place the symbol of the Sun in that division of the
Heavens and place against it the figures 11.10, so that as Aries 26 is
on the cusp of the Eighth and Taurus 26 on the cusp of the Ninth House,
the Sun's position in Taurus 11.10 will fall between these cusps,
_i.e._, in the Eighth House. The rest of the planets are placed in the
figure according to their respective longitudes.




CHAPTER III

THE TABLES OF HOUSES


The Tables of the Houses on pp. 40, 41, are calculated for the
latitude of 51° 32´ North. This will serve for London and environs,
and approximately for the South of England and the Midlands. Tables of
Houses for other latitudes may be obtained through the booksellers,
a useful set of half a dozen different latitudes being sold for one
shilling.

In order to illustrate the uses to which these Tables may be put in the
solution of astronomical problems, let us take the Sun's position in
the horoscope for the 1st of May, 1890, and find when the Sun sets on
that day on the horizon of London. The Sun is in Taurus, 11 degrees,
and it will set when the opposite point of the Heavens is rising.
Find under the column marked "Ascen." the 11th degree of Scorpio, and
against it in the column marked "Sidereal Time" you will find 9h. 49m.
9s. This will be the Right Ascension of the Midheaven when the Sun sets
on London. We have already seen that the Sidereal Time at noon on the
1st of May was 2h. 37m. 28s., and this, taken from the former Sidereal
Time, gives about 7.12 p.m. as the time of sunset. Now in the example
horoscope the birth took place at 3.30 p.m., and this time, taken from
7.12 p.m., gives 3h. 42m. from birth to sunset. If you multiply this by
15 to turn it into degrees and minutes of the Equator, you will obtain
55° 30´, which are the number of degrees which pass over the Midheaven
from birth until sunset. At the rate of 1 degree for every year of
life, this corresponds to 55-1/2 years of age, when the subject of this
horoscope would come under the adverse influence of the Sun opposition
Ascendant, and would suffer some serious ill health of a feverish
nature, incident to the throat (the part ruled by Taurus, the sign in
which the Sun is situate). This is how predictions are made, but of
this more anon.

If I wished to know what particular part of the Zodiac one is subject
to in any particular year of life--that is to say, what part of the
Zodiac is rising--I add 1 degree for every year to the Midheaven at
birth and thus obtain a new Midheaven, under which, in the Tables of
Houses, I find the Ascendant which rules the year. Thus in the case of
one born on the 1st of May at 3.30 p.m. the 30th year comes under the
Midheaven of Leo 2, which is 30 degrees further advanced than Cancer 2,
and under Leo 2 in the 10th House I find the Ascendant to be in Libra
24.7, which is the Ascendant governing that year of life. The meaning
and importance of these calculations will appear at a later stage of
this exposition.

When a degree is on the Midheaven or the 10th House it is said to
"culminate," and when on the horizon Eastward it is said to "ascend."

The Midheaven is often called the "M.C." (Medium Coeli), and the
opposite point is called the "I.C." (Imaum Coeli). They are the points
of the Ecliptic which cut through the meridian of a place at any given
time.




CHAPTER IV

PLANETARY TRANSITS


In order that prognostications made from the horoscope of birth may be
pointed as to time it is necessary to know the positions of the planets
for several years in advance. Such calculations are easily effected by
a knowledge of the periods of the planets--that is to say, the times
in which they return to the same positions about the same time of the
year. Thus Uranus returns to its place after a period of 84 years,
Saturn does so after 59 years, Jupiter in 83 years, Mars in 79 years,
in all cases almost to the day. Mercury also returns in 79 years. But
as very few people possess records of the planets' places for these
long periods, the following table of the longitudes of the planets for
the next 12 years has been prepared. The positions are given for the
1st of each month, and the longitudes held by the planets are given in
even degrees.

These tables are very useful in tracing the transits that occur in
connection with the horoscope for the year. Thus we have found that
by adding the number of degrees corresponding to the age of a person
to the Midheaven at birth, we obtain the Progressed Midheaven, and in
the Tables of Houses we may also find the corresponding Progressed
Ascendant. By adding the same number of degrees to the place of the Sun
at birth we obtain also the Progressed position of the Sun.

Now a transit of one of the major planets over any of these points,
namely, the Midheaven or Ascendant at birth, the Sun or Moon at birth,
the Midheaven, Ascendant, and Sun in the progress, will produce marked
effects on the fortunes and health of the Subject, corresponding to the
nature of the planet which makes the transit.

Thus we have seen that the Midheaven at the birth on the 1st of May,
1890, at 3.30 p.m., was Cancer 2 degrees, and the Ascendant Libra
2. Referring to the Tables, we find that in 1905 Saturn will form
the opposition of the Midheaven in Capricornus 2 in February, July,
and November, so that these will be periods of reversal, sudden and
unexpected complications and changes. Also the Sun at birth being in
Taurus 11 receives the transit of Jupiter in April, 1905, so that this
month will be productive of some amelioration of evils, or direct
benefits.

When two or more planets concur in a transit of any of the
Significators the results are so much the more forcible and effective.




CHAPTER V

TABLE OF ECLIPSES


The following Table of the Eclipses that will take place during the
next twelve years will be found of considerable use in forecasting
the effects which will follow, not only on the individual, but also
on nations and countries. Thus should any of the Eclipses fall on the
place of a Significator in a horoscope, it will have the most sinister
effect upon the life and fortunes. Certain countries are ruled by
certain signs, a matter which has been determined from observation
ever since the days of Claudius Ptolemy A.D. 130, and Eclipses
falling therein have the effect of disturbing the government of those
countries, producing effects of the worst kind. (See Sect. IV., chap.
6).

           14th July, Moon eclipsed in Capricornus 21.
           29th July, Sun eclipsed in Leo 5.

In illustration of the effects of Eclipses in the horoscope of birth,
we may refer to the horoscope of His Majesty King Edward VII., wherein
we find the sun situated in the 17th degree of the sign Scorpio, which
rules the excretory system. In May, 1902, there was an Eclipse of
the Sun in opposition to this position, and within five weeks of the
Eclipse the King was struck down with appendicitis on the eve of the
Coronation Ceremony. This was foretold in many of the journals devoted
to the exposition of Astrology, and in Moore's Almanac for the month of
June, 1902, the hieroglyphic clearly pointed to the danger that beset
the august Sovereign. Indeed, I was able to say with perfect assurance
that the Coronation would not take place on the date appointed, and
gave the exact date at which the King would be struck down with what
I conceived to be a mortal illness. But fortunately at that time the
Moon was conjoined to Jupiter in the progress and this saved the life.
The Moon was then setting in the horoscope of birth, according to the
measure of time already given, namely, one degree of Right Ascension
for one year of life, and Saturn was on the Midheaven.

The Eclipse of June 6, 1853, was in the Midheaven at Cumana on the
Spanish Main and in five weeks there followed a terrible earthquake
which killed 4,000 people and destroyed all the property. In May, 1901,
there was an Eclipse on the 8th of May which fell in the meridian
of St. Pierre, Martinique, and the same day there was a fearful
devastation of the place by the eruption of Mont Pelée.

Instances might be multiplied to show that the effects of Eclipses are
of the most striking and effective nature.




SECTION III

HOW TO READ THE HOROSCOPE




CHAPTER I

THE PLANETS IN THE HOUSES


It is impossible to categorically state the effects which are due to
the positions of the planets in the several Houses, because very much
depends upon the signs they are in and the aspects they have from other
planets.

The means of judging the effects is very simple, when once the natures
of the planets and the dominion of the several Houses have been
thoroughly digested. Thus, it is first necessary to see in what House
a planet is situated. Then consider the nature of the planet in the
following concrete manner:

    Neptune means chaos, confusion, deception.
    Uranus, eccentricity, originality, estrangement.
    Saturn, privation, hindrance, denial.
    Jupiter, affluence, fruitfulness, increase.
    Sun, dignities, honours.
    Mars, excess, impulse, quarrels.
    Venus, peace, happiness, agreement
    Mercury, commerce, versatility, adaptability.
    Moon, changes, publicity.

Now look to the things that are governed by the House in which any
particular planet is situated at the moment of birth (Sect. I., chap.
iii.).

Suppose Saturn to be found in the 11th House. Saturn is "privation" and
the 11th House is the domain of "Friends." Hence a paucity of friends,
or such as there may be are evil or unfortunate to the subject. Jupiter
in the 2nd House, in the same manner, would signify "increase" of
"money and possessions." Mars in the 7th would indicate "quarrels" with
"partners"; and so on. Each planet reflects its own nature upon the
affairs governed by the House in which it is found at the moment of
birth.

It will not infrequently happen, however, that there are more than one
planet in the same House. Suppose two planets to occupy the same House.
In such case one may be good (Jupiter), and the other evil (Mars). It
is then necessary to take first that which first comes to the horizon
or Midheaven, that is to say, the one which is in the earlier part of
the House, and next that which follows. Thus Saturn followed by Jupiter
in the 11th House, would signify misfortune by means of advisers and
friends, followed at a later period in the life by some great good
through the same source. The degrees which separate the planets will
indicate the years which elapse between these changes of fortune.
Similarly if there be more than two planets in the same House; in such
cases you may safely predict many changes in that department of life
which the House is said to rule.

But the fact of a planet being in a House is not of itself sufficient
evidence from which to make a judgment. The aspects which that planet
has must also be considered, for in this matter Saturn when throwing a
good aspect to any of the Significators--the Sun, Moon, Ascendant or
Midheaven, and well aspected by other planets, is to be preferred to
Jupiter when the latter is badly placed and aspected; for Jupiter has
his own ill effects, and Saturn has his good influences. Jupiter is
only a benefic when acting by conjunction or good aspect with another
planet, and Saturn is only a malefic when acting by conjunction or evil
aspect.

These things being duly considered, it is possible to arrive, with even
brief experience, at the results that are signified by the planets in
the several Houses.




CHAPTER II

THE CONSTITUTION


The Sun is the chief significator of the constitution, and the aspects
he holds to the other planets are to be considered. Thus if he be found
in good aspect, or at least not in evil aspect, to the other planets,
the constitution may be judged as sound.

When, however, the Sun is afflicted by some planets and assisted by
others, there will be only a moderate constitution, and judgment has
to be made as to which influence predominates, the good or evil.
When the afflicting planets are angular--that is to say, in the 1st,
4th, 7th, or 10th Houses--the congenital or hereditary tendency to
organic disease is by that circumstance so much the stronger. But when
the assisting planets are angular, the predisposition to disease is
considerably mitigated, and in most cases entirely overcome.

The predisposition of the body to affections of a constitutional nature
is to be judged from the prevalence of evil aspects to the Sun, and the
parts of the body liable to be affected are judged from the Signs which
are occupied by the afflicting bodies.

The various affections due to the several planets have already been
cited (Sect. I., chap. i.). The Signs are grouped for purposes of
pathological study as follows:--

The Movable Signs--Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricornus--have relation
to the head, stomach, skin, kidneys, liver, and spine.

The Fixed Signs--Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius--are related to the
throat, heart, blood, and excretory system.

The Common Signs--Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces--are related
to the lungs, bowels, and nervous system.

It will also be advisable to read Sect. I., chap. ii., in order to
determine the special points liable to affections, the nature of the
affection being judged solely by the planet which casts the malefic
aspect to the Sun.

When the Sun is found to be afflicted by several planets, and at the
same time there is no assistance from the good aspects or conjunctions
of other bodies, then the constitution is deemed faulty and liable to
early disruption. But when there are several planets afflicting and at
the same time some benefic influences from others, it is probable that
there will be prolonged disease and physical weakness, though life will
continue.

Death in infancy occurs when the malefic planets are immediately rising
or culminating at the birth in evil aspect to the luminary which at
the time may be above the horizon. Also when there are malefic planets
immediately setting or passing the nadir, in evil aspect to the
luminary below the horizon. But when there are mitigating influences
from the good aspects of the benefic planets, or the luminaries,
the malefic planets will not induce death, but there will be great
difficulty in rearing.




CHAPTER III

HEALTH AND SICKNESS


The aspects of the moon are the chief consideration in the matter of
sickness. If the Moon be found to be afflicted by the evil aspects
of several planets, and no assistance be given by the good aspects
of others, then the health will be precarious and frequent spells of
illness will result. The Moon being well aspected and not in any way
afflicted, shows that the health will be well established, and that
there will be immunity from sickness of all sorts.

The considerations necessary to be made in this matter are similar to
those which have been cited in regard to the Sun and the constitution,
except that we substitute the Moon for the Sun. For, whereas the Sun
governs the vital power in man, the Moon governs the functional powers,
and whereas the Sun denotes those affections which are congenital or
hereditary, the Moon denotes such as are brought about by causes after
birth. Similarly, the Sun denotes affections which are incidental to
the body, while the Moon denotes such as are accidental thereto.

These points being borne in mind, they may be memorised at sight:--

      SUN.                MOON.

    Organic.           Functional.
    Hereditary.        Acquired.
    Incidental.        Accidental.

But it should be observed that the constitution may be strong and the
health may be at the same time very bad, or, on the other hand, the
health may be good and the constitution may be weak. In the first case,
there would be a long life of considerable suffering from ill-health;
and in the second case, there would be little or no ill-health for some
considerable time, but the constitution would give way and the vital
powers become depleted by the first serious illness that occurred.

Only when the Sun and Moon are both unafflicted by evil aspects or
conjunctions, the health and constitution are both good, and there is
every indication of a robust and vigorous life reaching to a ripe old
age.

When the Sun and Moon are both heavily afflicted, and there is no
assistance given by good aspects, there is every probability of death
in infancy, or before reaching maturity.

For reasons which are allied to the connection existing between the
constitution and the health, the good aspect of the Moon to the Sun at
birth is an excellent augury, for it indicates co-ordination between
the organic and functional. Where this co-ordination exists there is
always considerable power of recuperation, so that illness is easily
overcome and the balance of power restored in the system.

Malefic planets rising and afflicting either the Sun or Moon indicate
prolonged ill-health, and most frequently some permanent hurt to the
body.

When predisposition to illness is shown in the horoscope, the
particular affection can be determined by the Sign which the afflicting
planets hold. Thus if Saturn afflict the Moon from Aries, you will
judge some hurts and obstructions in the head, chills and colds,
influenza, coryza, &c. Similarly Mars in Leo would indicate functional
defects of the heart due to accelerated action and overstrain, such as
result from fevers.

A good aspect of the planets Jupiter and Venus is of material help in
counteracting the influence of malefic aspects or evil positions.

Thus it will be seen that the health may be judged entirely apart from
the constitution, the planets which are in aspect to the Moon being of
first consideration, and next those which may be rising at the time of
birth.




CHAPTER IV

HOW TO READ CHARACTER AND DISPOSITION


Ptolemy says: "Mercury is the ruler of the rational soul, the Moon
of the animal soul." By this he would mean, no doubt, that Mercury
has relation to the faculty of the mind, while the Moon is related to
brain function. There are certain attributes of the mind which are
distinctive of the human being, and certain other qualities which
are common to man and the lower animals. These latter are under the
dominion of the Moon, while Mercury has chief signification of the
rational faculties.

The position and aspects of the Moon and Mercury are therefore to be
considered in making judgment of the mental endowments and disposition
of the subject.

Planets that are in conjunction or aspect to either the Moon or Mercury
will impress their nature strongly on the character and disposition.
The natures of the planets have already been recited (Sect. I., chap.
i.), and it is therefore only necessary to consider further, in this
connection, the nature of the aspect that is thrown to the Mental
Significators by the other bodies. Thus the Sun being in trine to the
Moon will give a proper degree of independence and dignity, while the
square aspect or opposition of the Sun would indicate an excess of
pride, harmful to the subject in his ordinary relationships. In the
same manner, the good aspect of Jupiter would show benevolence and
regulated philanthropy, while the opposition or other evil aspect of
the same body would indicate extravagance and ostentatious display of
charity.

The good and bad aspects of the planets may be summed up in a few lines
as follows:--

          IN GOOD ASPECT.                  IN EVIL ASPECT.

    Neptune--Genius, inspiration.       Insanity, obsession.
    Uranus--Originality, invention.     Obstinacy, eccentricity.
    Saturn--Steadfastness, fidelity.    Deceitfulness, suspicion.
    Jupiter--Benevolence, joviality.    Ostentation, profligacy.
    Mars--Energy, executiveness.        Impulse, destructiveness.
    Sun--Dignity, independence.         Vanity, egotism.
    Venus--Affability, art.             Self-indulgence, disorderliness.
    Mercury--Alertness, ingenuity.      Inquisitiveness, meddling.
    Moon--Grace, idealism.              Inconstancy, awkwardness.

The general trend of the disposition and habit of mind is judged
by the position of the majority of the planets, according to the
"Constitution" of the Signs they occupy. Thus, the majority of the
planets being in--

Cardinal or Movable Signs indicates executive ability, business
aptitude, pioneer spirit, ambition, capability to cut out a line in
life for oneself, and to make headway against difficulties. Such
persons are usually the foremost in their particular sphere of life,
and are always found in the most progressive movements, reforms, &c.

Fixed Signs--Stability, patience, endurance, method, caution, and
diplomacy. Such persons are apt to become the originators of schools
of thought, policies, and schemes. They have fixity of purpose,
determination, independence, and pivotal stability. They sit still and
the world revolves around them.

Flexed or Common Signs--Versatility, flexibility, suavity,
adaptability, and lack of originality. Such people usually have too
many irons in the fire, and take in hand more than they can bring to
satisfactory conclusion. This is due to their versatility. They have a
superficial knowledge of many things, but lack the persistence to bring
that knowledge to practical effect. At the same time their adaptability
is the occasion of many successes in life, and their agreeableness,
sympathy, and suavity create many friends for them.

In the Wheel of Life the cardinal signs denote the rim or tyre which is
ever on the move, having the greatest acceleration. The Common Signs
represent the spokes of the wheel, uniting the tyre to the nave, and
in that sense representing the power of adaptability. The Fixed Signs
represent the nave, which remains quiescent and still, being useful by
that pivotal stability and apparent non-entity.

Thus, while the Sign-groupings of the planets are useful in giving the
keynote of the nature and disposition, the particular faculties and
characteristics are to be judged only from the aspects of the planets
to the Moon and Mercury. Further, it will be noted that those planets
which occupy the 3rd and 9th Houses, and those also which are just
rising at the moment of birth, will strongly impress themselves on the
nature, apart from any aspects they may hold to the Mental Rulers. This
is on account of the natural relationship of those Houses to the mind
and its means of expression.

Due attention must be paid to the position and aspects of those planets
which are in aspect to the Mental Rulers, for if they be badly placed,
in uncongenial signs, and themselves badly aspected by other planets,
they will not act with the same directness and force as they otherwise
would do.

It is of course admitted, in all astrological inquiries, that the
effects of heredity, training and association count for something. A
man who is generated from a vitiated parentage, badly nourished and
imperfectly trained, cannot be expected, even with the best aspects,
to manifest the highest faculties in their fullest or most perfect
expressions. I have not the slightest doubt that many a clodpole was
born under similar aspects to those which obtained at the birth of
Shakespeare, Raphael, Newton, or Cæsar. I am not dismayed. _Non gli
astri muovono solamente per Roma!_ Who shall tell the tale of the
world's starved, neglected, and submerged genius? We are doing the
right thing, at all events, in keeping the school-door wide open.

But to continue. The inspirational and ardent temperament is indicated
by the majority of planets being in Fiery signs. The mental or
intellectual temperament is shown by the majority in Aerial signs. The
psychic or emotional temperament by the majority in Watery signs, and
the practical or sordid temperament by the majority being in Earthy
signs.

The rising sign at birth often impresses itself strongly on the mind
of the Subject, and its characteristics are those which belong to the
planet which governs it, and the "elemental" nature of the sign itself.

Thus you have the chief keys to the estimate of character in the
individual, and when once the student is convinced by experience of the
paramount reliability of this method of character-delineation, its uses
will need no special pointing.


Mental and Brain Disorders.

When either the Moon or Mercury is afflicted by the malefic planets,
that is to say, when Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, or Mars are in
conjunction or evil aspect with the mental Significators, and there be
no relieving aspect from the benefic planets, Jupiter, Venus, or the
Sun, then there is every predisposition to affections of the brain and
nervous system. This is the more to be feared when the Moon or Mercury
is afflicted in the flexed or common signs. This observation has been
scientifically established by Mr. A. G. Trent, in his little work
entitled "The Soul and the Stars," to which the student is referred for
a mass of statistical evidence.




CHAPTER V

FINANCIAL PROSPECTS


Look to the planets which are in the 2nd House, and the aspects to
them. If any planet be therein, and well aspected by others, the
financial condition will be competent. If a benefic (Jupiter or Venus)
be therein, and free from evil aspects, the same effect will accrue.
But if the benefic in the 2nd should have good aspects from other
planets, then there will be considerable wealth.

Any planet in the 2nd House, badly aspected, will produce difficulty in
acquiring money, and if it be a malefic planet which occupies the 2nd
House under these conditions, there will be times of stress and even
poverty.

Continual hardship and poverty is shown by malefic planets in the 2nd
House, in evil aspect to the Moon or Sun; while at the same time the
planets in the 2nd House will be severely afflicted by others.

Saturn in the Midheaven afflicting the Sun or Moon is an indication
of reversal of fortune, and such persons usually attain considerable
position in the world and are then depleted of everything.

Jupiter or Venus in the 10th House, and near the meridian, are signs of
good fortune and success in life, and the same results are due to their
rising at birth.

In a general manner the aspects to the Moon in a male horoscope or
the Sun in a female horoscope should be consulted, and the planets in
good aspect thereto will show the means of good fortune, while those
in evil aspect will indicate the sources of loss and hurt, according
to the Houses the afflicting or assisting planets occupy. Thus Jupiter
in good aspect to the Moon from the 11th House shows gain by friends,
advisers, and co-operative measures, because the 11th House rules these
relationships and Jupiter is the index of increase. Similarly, Uranus
in the 7th House would show gain by the marriage partner if in good
aspect to the Moon, or loss thereby if in evil aspect.

Mars in the 2nd House shows good earning capacity, because Mars is an
ambitious and industrious planet (_i.e._, it produces such effects in
the person), and the 2nd House is the domain of finance. But at the
same time it shows extravagance and inability to save money, for Mars
is impulsive and lacking thrift.

The 6th House well occupied shows faithful and advantageous servants
and employés, such as will augment the fortunes and do good work for
the Subject.

Neptune in the 2nd shows complications and an involved state of
finance, and frequently it shows loss by fraud and imposition; though
in good aspect to other planets it shows gain by such nefarious means.
Uranus indicates many ups and downs of fortune, sudden and unexpected
rises and falls.

Thus each planet is judged according to its nature and the aspect it
throws to the Moon or Sun, while the planets in the 2nd House are
judged by their own natures and the aspects which they receive.

Inheritance is shown by a benefic planet in the 5th or 11th House in
good aspect to Saturn; but indirect inheritance can be the result of
Saturn in good aspect to Jupiter from any part of the figure.

Legacies are shown by good planets, or planets well aspected, in the
8th House; or by Jupiter in good aspect to Uranus from any part of the
heavens.

Gain by marriage is shown by benefic planets in the 8th House, because
the 8th is 2nd from the 7th, and the 7th House rules over the partner.

The potential of each horoscope is capable of being increased by
due attention to the sources of gain, as shown by the position and
aspects of the planets in various parts of the heavens; but chiefly by
associating oneself with persons whose horoscopes are in harmony with
one's own. Thus it happens that individuals are lifted to position and
affluence through their association with persons whose horoscopes are
in sympathy with theirs. (See Chap. XI. of this Section.)

The Sun and Moon being in good aspect to one another will prevent
disaster, or will always provide a means of restoration of fortunes,
because it is an index of general good fortune and continual support.
Such persons as have this aspect in their horoscopes need never fear
misfortune, for if they should fall into disasters in one place,
they will always turn up in another with a complete adjustment of
their position. But when the Sun and Moon are in evil aspect, and
particularly when the malefic planets are in elevation in the heavens,
continual misfortune dogs the footsteps, and though there be spells of
good fortune, they are brief and attended with troubles.

The benefic planets, Jupiter, Venus, and Sun, being well elevated in
the heavens, that is to say, in the 10th or 11th Houses, it is a sign
of preponderating good fortune. But when the malefics are in elevation
the reverse results happen.


The Line of Least Resistance.

It is a law in Nature that the line of least resistance is that of
greatest progress. The lightning flash does not come straight to earth,
but zigzag by the line of least resistance. The great rivers do not
come by a direct course to the ocean, but by many turns and backward
reaches, because they follow the path of least resistance. When one
comes to take account of the years of human life that are spent in the
vain endeavour to achieve the impossible, the lessons of Nature are
worth reciting. But what is impossible to one man is facile to another,
and the greatest economy of effort is therefore to be secured by proper
regard to suitability of occupation and direction of effort.

The principles of Astrology enable us to determine the line of action
which at all times will be the most fruitful of results, and in the
matter of money-making the matter is decided in the following manner:
That planet which has a trine or sextile aspect of the Moon, and is
at the same time elevated above the malefic planets, especially if
it be itself assisted by the good aspects of other planets, receives
first consideration. The House it is in will indicate the source of
benefit, but the Sign it is in will show the means through which it
will come. Thus if Uranus should be in the Midheaven, in trine aspect
to the Moon, and itself receiving a good aspect from either the Sun,
Jupiter, or Venus, it will indicate gain through governmental bodies,
authorities, and persons of high rank. If Uranus should be in the sign
Cancer, it would point to matters associated with the ocean, marine
affairs, or those in which water is the element in chief employ; as
in marine engineering, shipping, dock building, &c. But if Uranus had
been in the 11th House, and in the sign Scorpio, then the source of
gain would be by means of companies, syndicates, and associations of a
collective nature, and the sign Scorpio would show it to be connected
with naval defence (because Scorpio is a martial and watery sign) or
the utilisation of waste materials, inflammable oils, &c., or by systems
of drainage, which represent the excretory system of a town. By looking
chiefly to the nature of the planet concerned, and that of the sign it
occupies, a good artist will readily describe the particular line which
is to be pursued.

But here, as in every other matter upon which judgment is made,
attention must be paid to the character and disposition of the Subject,
his aptitudes and qualifications, for it is obviously of little use
recommending literature or the law to one whose sole capabilities lie
in unintellectual directions. Natural aptitude, supplemented by the
necessary training, are the first considerations, for without these
success in any direction is but ill assured.




CHAPTER VI

THE POSITION IN LIFE


This is to be judged from the position of the majority of the planets,
but principally from the Midheaven, the planets therein and its
aspects. Thus, if you find the majority of the planets rising, that is
to say, in the 10th, 11th, 12th, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Houses the Subject
will be a candidate for responsibility, ambitious of honours and
position, and generally independent. If these or the majority of them
be well aspected he will become a man of position, employing others;
or, if a woman, will hold an important position in her sphere of life,
and be esteemed in the social world.

If the degree on the Midheaven receives good aspects from the major
planets, the position will be honourable and secure.

Venus or Jupiter, or the Sun well aspected, in the Midheaven, denotes
a superior position, honours, and distinction. The same will result if
these be rising.

When the majority of the planets are above the horizon, even though
they be not rising, the Subject will have responsibilities thrust upon
him, even though he should not desire them. If the majority of these
planets be well aspected, he will acquit himself creditably and attain
to honours.

It is always fortunate for the position that there should be planets
exactly on the cusps of either the 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 8th, or 12th
Houses, for then there will be every opportunity of securing fame and
advancement in life.

But when any of the malefic planets are found exactly on or nearest to
the meridian, whether above or below the horizon, there will be loss of
position, reversal, a sinister fame, or disgrace.

The 10th House represents the fame and honour of a person, and the 4th
House represents the end of life and that which militates against the
fame and honour. Therefore when there are good planets in these places,
the Subject will meet with rewards and honours commensurate with his
efforts; but when evil planets occupy the meridian, he will at best
sustain his position in life with great difficulty.

It is futile for any one to suppose that the position of a benefic
planet in the meridian of the horoscope will bring him to fame and
elevate him in the world irrespective of his own endeavours. The
planets operate on human affairs in terms of human thought and action,
and that by fixed laws; never adventitiously. That "the Gods help those
who help themselves" to the extent that natural laws permit, is a truth
which astrology fully provides for. Fitness and fortune are as cause
and effect to one another in respect of planetary action in human life.

Many planets in cardinal signs will dispose a man to seek fame, and
when the Midheaven of the horoscope is well aspected or there be
fortunate planets therein, he will attain it. Cardinal signs on the
angles of the horoscope (the meridian and horizon), produce fame
outlasting death. The same if either of the luminaries be exactly on
the equinoxes.

Venus in the Midheaven gives social elevation and lifts a person above
the sphere of birth. Good planets in the 11th show patronage.

But when the luminaries are heavily afflicted there will be an
inconstant fortune and many reverses, so that position gained will be
lost again.

Most of the planets under the horizon shows success and position in the
latter part of life, while if they be between the 4th and 7th cusps,
there will be advantages after marriage, or by means of partnerships.

In judging of the means by which the position will be sustained,
respect must be had to the positions of those planets which are in good
aspect to the Midheaven, or to benefic planets in the Midheaven, and
if none be so situated, then those which hold benefic aspect to either
the Sun or Moon at birth must be taken, and judgment made according to
the nature of the planet and the sign it occupies. Preference should
always be given to that planet which has the strongest aspect for good.
Thus if two planets were in trine, that which is in elevation should
be preferred, especially if it be strengthened by the good aspects of
other planets.




CHAPTER VII

THE CHOICE OF OCCUPATION


The enormous waste of force and time entailed by the experimental trip
upon which most young men embark at the outset of their career in life,
might be greatly reduced by a proper knowledge of individual aptitude
in relation to circumstances. The average boy cannot readily make up
his mind as to what occupation he will follow, because he does not know
either enough of his own powers or of the world in which he is called
upon to use them. Parents are in the same difficulty. They must needs
wait to see how a boy will shape out. They study his inclinations to
the best of their ability, but without coming to a definite conclusion
any sooner than the boy himself. Given a fair education, such as may
fit him for almost anything, but which specialises him for nothing in
particular, he is put to some desk or bench and there left to his own
resources. By a fortunate chance, he may find himself suited to his
post. More frequently he is several years in finding out that he has
missed his vocation, that his inclinations and his work are not in
accord, that he has misapplied his energies for some time, and that he
has made a false start. Fortunately circumstanced at birth he may have
been equipped by higher education for some distinctive profession, to
which he gains access after the payment of large fees or premiums. The
man has a strong dramatic faculty and the stage claims him after all.
Here is both waste of time and money. Astrology, as a reliable key to
character and inclination, deserves some recognition on the grounds of
social economy.

The inclinations of the Subject are judged from the position of the
majority of the planets, for if they should be found in the aerial
signs, Gemini, Libra, or Aquarius, the inclination will be towards
mental occupations, especially science and literature. In fiery signs
there is a predisposition to a more robust and active life, such as
is afforded by military service, travelling, prospecting, exploring,
&c. In earthy signs the aptitude lies in the direction of agriculture,
experimental science, surveying, dealing in real estate, broking, &c.
In watery signs there is special inclination to pursuits connected with
the water, such as sailors, watermen, and others; but frequently to
other occupation in which fluids are predominant, such as publicans,
wine and spirit merchants, chemists, and oil merchants.

Each sign has its special tendency, and the exact occupation can
often be decided thereby, when regard is had to the planet in closest
aspect to the Sun or Moon and the sign it occupies. Thus Aries denotes
soldiers and pioneers of movements; Taurus shows dealers in real
estate, house agents and brokers; Gemini, literary men and writers of
all sorts; Cancer, sailors and publicans; Leo, actors and artists;
Virgo, clothes dealers and sellers of confectionery and bread; Libra,
valuers, assayers, money-changers, and pawnbrokers; Scorpio, naval
sailors, chemists, dealers in oils and spirits; Sagittarius, explorers,
divines, lawyers; Capricornus, political agents and ministers of
the State; Aquarius, electricians, company promoters, syndics, and
scientific researchers; Pisces, dealers in fish and sea produce,
warders, and those connected with places of confinement, such as
prisons and hospitals.

Taking, therefore, the dominant planet and the signs that hold the
majority of the planets, the line along which the Subject will make the
most progress in the world and acquit himself most successfully, may be
readily determined.

No person will make a good soldier who has not Mars as a dominant
planet, nor will he succeed with the public if the Moon be not elevated
and well aspected, nor become a successful artist, musician, or poet if
Venus be not conspicuous in the horoscope.

Generally the inclination is derived from a consideration of the
dominant planet, and the degree of success attendant upon the
occupation is judged from the aspect which that planet throws to the
Sun or Moon, and there can be no great advantage from following an
inclination which does not promise some measure of success, as is the
case when the dominant planet is in evil aspect to the luminaries. Thus
it happens that some men follow unprofitable callings, their judgment
being dominated by an inclination adverse to their natural welfare. Yet
never was good work done in the world without a strong inclination and
considerable enthusiasm, and Heaven makes its own slaves, its martyrs,
and its scapegoats. And always, the following of an inclination means
the sacrifice of some of the benefits of life. "Take what thou wilt,
but pay the price!" is the Divine mandate, according to Emerson.

But unquestionably, the science which enables a man to choose the line
of least resistance, which prevents a youth of intellectual tendencies
from wasting the best years of his life in drudgery at the desk or
bench, is worth a little study. "Hitch your waggon to a star," is good
advice if only we hitch it to the right one.




CHAPTER VIII

MARRIAGE CIRCUMSTANCES


The question as to how, when, and where marriage will take place is
an all-absorbing one to the majority of men and women, and no less
important than interesting. Astrology has made it possible to answer
these questions categorically and with particular precision and verity.

The conditions of connubial life are judged (in a male horoscope)
from the condition of the Moon and Venus, and (in a female horoscope)
from that of the Sun and Mars. The planet to which the luminary first
forms an aspect after birth (that which it "applies" to) denotes the
marriage partner. If the aspect be good there will be agreement and
the choice of a partner will be fortunate. But if the aspect be evil,
there will be trouble after marriage. The nature of the planet to which
the luminary forms its aspect after birth ought also to be considered,
for if it be that the luminary applies by a good aspect to a benefic
planet, or to one that is well-placed and aspected, then there will be
considerable happiness and fortune in marriage. On the other hand, if
both the aspect and the planet be evil--as if the Moon were applying to
the opposition of Saturn or Uranus or Mars--then the fate in marriage
will be extremely unhappy and disagreements will be frequent and even
permanent.

When the aspect and the nature of the planet are at variance, as when
the Moon has a good aspect to Saturn, or a bad aspect to Jupiter, there
will be a mingled fortune of good and ill in marriage. There is no
better sign of happiness and harmony in marriage than a good aspect
between the Sun and Moon.

Moreover, it may happen that the Moon applies by good aspect to a
planet after birth, and that there is at the same time a malefic body
in the 7th House. This indicates that there will be agreement in the
connubial life, but that bereavement will soon follow.

When the Moon applies to Neptune there will be some peculiarity or
touch of genius in the partner, according as Neptune may be aspected.
Uranus shows eccentricity and sometimes wilfulness. Saturn shows
steadiness, industry; or jealousy and coldness. Jupiter indicates a
good nature, bountiful and honest, but may be given to excess and
extravagance. Mars induces industry and practicality, but it gives a
strong temper and considerable independence. The Sun shows dignity and
loyalty, but may indicate ostentation and foolish pride. Venus denotes
peacefulness and a genial, refined nature, but its perversion brings
indifference, neglect and disorderliness. Mercury denotes an active and
energetic nature, but may produce a busybody and meddler.

Everything depends on the aspect which the significant luminary
throws to the planet it applies to, for if the aspect be good it will
indicate the better qualities of that planet; but if evil, then there
is frequently the unfortunate consequence of choosing a partner in whom
the perverted qualities of the planet are predominant.

Good planets in the 7th House indicate a good partner, but when at the
same time the aspect of the luminary is evil, it will denote a good
marriage, followed by bereavement.

Marriage to a widow (or widower) occurs when Mars and Saturn are the
planets concerned in the indications, as if Mars be in the 7th House
and in aspect to Saturn, or if the Moon apply to Mars when aspected by
Saturn, or when one of them is in the 5th House and the other in the
7th.

Love affairs before marriage are indicated by the 5th House, the
planets therein and their aspects, and in a general sense by Venus in a
male horoscope and Mars in a female horoscope.

Thus if Venus (or Mars) be afflicted by Saturn or Uranus there will be
disappointment in the early affections. Uranus in aspect to Venus gives
romantic attachments and much influence over the other sex. Neptune in
aspect shows idealism, and when afflicting Venus it produces chaos and
entanglement, danger of seduction. Mars afflicting Venus gives ardour
and impulse.


More than one Marriage

is indicated when the luminary is in aspect to more than one planet in
a double-bodied sign, _e.g._, Gemini, Sagittarius, or Pisces. Or, if
the luminary itself be in a double sign and in aspect to any planet
other than one which may be in the 7th House. Also a double sign being
on the cusp of the 7th House, and the luminary in a fruitful sign,
Cancer, Scorpio, or Pisces, or in aspect to planets in those signs. All
these are signs of more than one marriage during life.

Signs of separation or divorce are as follows: The luminary applying to
the ill aspect of a malefic planet, Venus afflicted, and Uranus in the
7th House or afflicting the Moon or Venus. In female horoscopes change
the Significators, taking the Sun and Mars instead of the Moon and
Venus, and judge the same.

Where more than one marriage is shown, the ruler of the 7th House
denotes the first partner, and the planet ruling the sign it occupies
is called its "dispositor" or "displacer." This dispositor represents
the second partner.

The planet to which the significant luminary applies is that which is
taken to describe the partner, according to the sign it is in. But
if this planet be retrograde, i.e., going backwards in the zodiac by
apparent motion, then it only represents an attachment which will
be broken off. Its dispositor then becomes the significator of the
partner. But the ruler of the 7th House is taken for the condition
and fortunes of the partner, and if it be afflicted or badly placed
and weak in the horoscope, then the marriage will be ill-assorted,
unfortunate, and full of dissatisfaction. The contrary is the case when
the significant planet is well placed and aspected.

The place or circumstances under which the partner will be met may
be known from the sign and house occupied by the planet to which the
luminary first applies after birth. Thus if it be in the 11th House,
the partner will be met among friends, at the house of a friend, or
introduced by a friend. If in the 3rd House, then on a short journey or
in correspondence; in the 5th, at a place of amusement; in the 10th, in
the course of business; and so on, judgment being made according to the
places and circumstances ruled by the House occupied by the planet.




CHAPTER IX

INDICATIONS OF PROGENY


The 5th House, the planets therein and the position and aspects of the
Moon, have to be considered in this matter.

If the 5th House be occupied by benefic planets, or planets well
aspected by others, then the progeny will be a source of satisfaction
and credit to the Subject, and will be reared to maturity. But the
contrary is the case when the 5th House is occupied by malefic planets
and such as may be heavily afflicted.

The Moon represents the tendency in the male and the capacity in the
female, and when well aspected, or free from evil aspects and well
placed, then there will be good fortune in connection with the progeny.

When Uranus afflicts a planet in the 5th House, there will be some
premature births, and generally it will be observed that when planets
are opposed from the 11th and 5th Houses, or malefic planets occupy
those houses, there is trouble through the progeny, and usually the
loss of one or more during infancy is to be feared.

As to the number of children, no empirical rules exist for the judgment
of this matter, which necessarily is a difficult one owing to the fact
that we have no means of comparing the horoscopes of man and wife, but
the nature of the sign on the cusp of the 5th House is usually to be
depended upon for an approximation. Thus Aries, Leo, and Capricornus
give small families. Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, and Pisces give
large families, and the other signs yield a moderate family. When the
Moon is strong, angular, and not afflicted, the number is increased.
Twins are born from double-bodied signs occupying the cusp of the 5th
House, or planets in the 5th in a double-bodied sign.

The condition of each child is known in a general manner from the
alternate Houses, commencing with the 5th. Thus the first child is (in
a male horoscope) ruled by the 5th House, and planets therein; the
second child by the 7th House; the third by the 9th House, and so on.
In a female horoscope the first child is ruled by the 4th House; the
second by the 6th House, and so on.

Thus if it be found that there is probability of loss of some of the
progeny, the children most liable to affliction may be known by this
method; for the Houses which contain the malefic planets, or the
afflicted planets, correspond to the afflicted progeny.

Illustrious children are born to the Subject when the ruler of the 5th
House is in elevation and well aspected, and in a congenial sign. But
if the ruler of the 5th House be badly placed and aspected and in a
sign of debility, _i.e._, opposite to one over which it rules, then the
progeny are ill-equipped for the battle of life, either mentally or
morally. The particular qualities and fortunes of the progeny can only
be known from their individual horoscopes.

When malefic planets hold the 12th House in a female horoscope, there
will be danger in confinement; and the same happens if either of the
luminaries, but particularly the Moon, be afflicted in the 5th House.




CHAPTER X

VOYAGES AND JOURNEYS


The indications of short journeys, inland and around the coast, are
to be judged from the 3rd House and the planets therein. If a movable
sign be on the cusp of the 3rd House, or planets in a movable sign
occupy the 3rd House, then there will be much travelling and many
short journeys to and fro. The aspects to these planets in the 3rd
will indicate whether such journeys will be mainly successful or not.
When there are no aspects to the planet or planets in the 3rd House
the fortune of short journeys is to be judged from the nature of the
planet in the 3rd, as if Jupiter, they will be fortunate and lucrative;
but if Saturn, unfortunate and subject to many hindrances and delays.
When malefic planets are afflicted in the 3rd House, or malefic planets
in the 3rd throw evil aspects to the Sun or Moon, then there will be
dangers and accidents.

Watery signs on the cusp of the 3rd House, or planets in watery signs
in the 3rd, indicate cruising and yachting, short journeys by water
around the coast. If the Moon be in good aspect to these planets, then
there will be safety in passage; but if afflicted by the planets in the
3rd there will be danger of collision, capsizing, &c., according to the
nature of the planet in the 3rd House.

Long voyages are to be judged in exactly similar manner from the 9th
House, the planets therein and their aspects.

The 4th House indicates the place of birth, and if this House hold a
benefic planet, or either the Sun or Moon, well aspected, then there is
fortune in the place of birth, and journeys should only be undertaken
when they are without doubt fortunate in their issues and admit of a
return to the native place. When, however, the 4th House is occupied
by evil planets or planets heavily afflicted, it will be advisable to
remove from the place of birth and seek fortune in more propitious
localities.

In this matter the choice is made by reference to that planet which
holds the greatest power for good in the horoscope of birth, and the
quarter of the Heavens which it occupies will indicate the direction,
as from the place of birth, to which the Subject should repair.

Thus, if between the East horizon and the meridian, South-east; between
the meridian and the West horizon, South-west; and so of the rest. The
points of the compass follow the cardinal points of the Heavens, the
Midheaven being South; the Nadir, North; the Ascendant, East; and the
Descendant, West. If a malefic planet is rising or setting at birth it
is advisable to fix the place of residence so much to the Eastward of
the birthplace as will suffice to bring the malefic planets out of the
angles of the horoscope. The same if malefic planets occupy the 10th
or 4th Houses. On the contrary, if benefic planets are in the 3rd and
9th Houses the Subject should move Westward so as to bring the benefic
influences into the 10th and 4th Houses.

When benefic planets or planets well aspected occupy the angles of the
figure at birth the Subject should not travel far, nor reside long away
from the place of birth.

Indications of many voyages are as follows: Many planets in watery
signs, Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces, and also in the sign Virgo. When
the majority of the planets are in cardinal and flexed signs, Aries,
Gemini, Cancer, Virgo, Libra, Sagittarius, Capricornus, and Pisces,
there will be many changes and journeys. Also if the Sun, Moon, Mars,
and Mercury are in either the 3rd, 9th, 12th, or 6th Houses, there will
be many journeys and long explorations in foreign countries.

When planets are afflicted in watery signs there will be danger in
voyages, and if the Moon or Sun be afflicted in Virgo there will be
submersion due to wreck.

Also, when there are planets, especially malefics, in Scorpio, Leo,
Taurus, and Aquarius, afflicted by the aspects of other planets, or
themselves afflicting the Sun or Moon, then there is danger of drowning.

When the signs of voyaging are propitious, and especially when the
indications in the 4th House are not so, then removal from the place of
birth to some other permanent centre of activity will be advisable. But
when good planets or planets well aspected are either rising or in the
4th House, the Subject should remain in his native place, and in the
end his patience will be justified.




CHAPTER XI

OF FRIENDS AND ENEMIES


The general harmony of the horoscope consists in the positions and
aspects of the planets and their relations with the luminaries. When
this is conspicuous there will be many friends and supporters, and the
associations of the Subject will be pleasant and profitable. But when
the horoscope is fraught with evil aspects and angular positions of the
malefics there will be much strife and many enmities.

In a particular sense the friends and associations of the Subject are
to be known from the 11th House and the planets therein. For if there
be a benefic planet in the 11th, especially if in good aspect to either
of the luminaries, there will be many friends and adherents.

Similarly, the enemies of the Subject are known from the 7th House, and
secret enemies from the 12th. Malefic planets therein, especially in
evil aspect to the Sun or Moon, shows many opponents.

Neptune in any malefic aspect to the Sun or Moon shows danger of
deceit and treachery being practised upon the Subject, and if violent
testimonies concur from the ill aspects of Mars or Uranus he will be
in danger of an ambush. Saturn in the 7th or 12th shows long feuds and
implacable enmities. Uranus therein shows litigation and heckling of
creditors. Mars therein is an index of violence and passionate hatred.
Mercury therein shows much scandal and many petty annoyances.

Now observe the places of the malefic planets and the Houses wherein
they are situated. Take the date when the Sun is in the same longitude
as any of these malefic planets, which will be the same in any year,
and this will be the birthday of persons who are to be avoided as
likely to bring mischief into the life. Supposing, for instance, that
Saturn is found at birth in the 10th House, in the 13th degree of
the sign Aquarius. Reference to the Ephemeris (Sect. II., chap. i.)
will show that the Sun is in Aquarius 13 on the 1st and 2nd February.
Hence it would be unfortunate for the Subject to serve any man who
was born between the 28th January and the 3rd February in any year.
Also, if Uranus were in Leo 23 in the 7th House he should not go into
partnership or marriage with anybody born on or near the 15th August in
any year.

Take now the places of the benefic planets, and also the place of the
Moon, and find the corresponding Solar dates, for these will be the
birth dates of such persons as should be cultivated and drawn into
close association for mutual benefit.

Observe also the trines and sextiles of the benefic planets and of the
Moon, and the squares and oppositions of the malefics, for these will
operate in a minor degree in a similar manner as already indicated.

A comparison of the horoscopes of persons, whether kings or plebeians,
with those of others who have wrought great good or evil in their
lives, will immediately establish this observation. Indeed there is
nothing more dependable in the whole range of scientific observation
than this sympathy and antipathy of horoscopes and their corresponding
results. It is an argument for the claim of its advocates that
Astrology should be regarded in the light of a science, for if the
planets act not at all upon the dispositions and tendencies of men
their squares and oppositions in two separate horoscopes would have
no signification. Let those who are unhappily mated compare their
horoscopes and they will find the signs of discord to which reference
has been made above. On the other hand, let any man who has been lifted
to wealth, fame, or position by the patronage of another compare his
horoscope with that of his benefactor, and it will be found that
the benefic planets in the latter hold the places of the Sun, Moon,
Midheaven, or Ascendant in his own. This frequently accounts for the
fact that men with comparatively unfortunate horoscopes are sometimes
found in positions of influence and in the enjoyment of considerable
fortune. The complex fabric of life has its warp and woof wherein many
coloured threads are woven together for the completing of the grand
design, and the great loom of life has its wheels within wheels which
only the Great Artificer can understand and regulate. We here below,
subjects all of interplanetary action, must content ourselves with the
design as revealed to us in the history of mankind, or we must seek
to understand the purpose of life, its motif, the complex laws which
operate to bring about the unfoldment of the great plan, and thence to
prognosticate that which hereafter shall be revealed to the commonplace
observer.




CHAPTER XII

THE END OF LIFE


The end of life is judged from the planets occupying the 8th and 4th
Houses, for the 8th denotes Death, and the 4th denotes the final
resting-place of man. When benefic planets, or the Luminaries well
aspected, occupy these Houses, you may judge that the end will be
peaceful, normal, and that death will take place in the midst of
congenial and even exceptionally agreeable surroundings.

When, however, the malefic planets hold these Houses, or afflict the
luminaries therein, you may judge greater stress and privation.

Uranus in the 8th House denotes a sudden death, and the same result is
observed when the Luminaries therein are afflicted by Uranus. Neptune
in the 8th denotes danger of trance, coma, and simulated death, and
when this position is observed it is necessary that all the signs of
mortification should be present before interment is effected. Saturn
produces death by privation and obstructions, by chills and colds. Mars
induces death by fevers and inflammatory action, and frequently by
hæmorrhage.

Planets in Fixed signs in the 8th House show death from heart or
throat affections, affections of the excretory system and the blood.
In Cardinal signs, the head, stomach, kidneys, or skin are the seats
of the fatal disease. In Flexed signs, the lungs, bowels, and nervous
system become fatally affected.

Violent or unnatural deaths are shown when either of the luminaries is
simultaneously afflicted by the evil aspects of more than one of the
malefic planets, or when both luminaries are separately afflicted by
the malefic aspects of malefic planets, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, or
Mars.

When these testimonies occur, it will be found that Neptune produces
death by assassination, Uranus by sudden catastrophes, explosions,
hurts by electricity and machinery, Saturn by blows and falls, and Mars
by cuts, burns, scalds, and effusion of blood. Particular judgment is
drawn from the nature of the signs in which the significant planets
are placed. Thus Saturn in Watery signs would produce drowning;
in Taurus, strangling or decapitation; in Aries by the blow of a
truncheon, &c. Similarly, Uranus in Gemini would produce accidents on
short journeys, railway collisions, bicycle or motor accidents, and
the like effects. It is impossible to cite all the effects due to the
several planets in the different signs, but if the simple natures of
the planets, signs and Houses are thoroughly understood, a combination
of their significations will readily lead to an appreciation of exact
effects. If I say that a certain fluid is H{2}SO{4}, any one having a
knowledge of elementary chemistry will know that it is sulphuric acid,
and similarly, if I say that a certain horoscope contains Saturn in
Cancer in the 3rd, which is astrologically expressed [symbol: Saturn]
[symbol: Cancer] 3, any one who has read the first pages of this book
with attention will be able to say: Let the Subject beware of short
journeys by water! It is all chemistry of a kind.

When the 4th House contains benefic planets, or planets that throw good
aspects to the luminaries, there will be peace and comfort in old age,
or in the end of life whensoever it may be determined. Neptune therein
shows retirement and sequestration, and when afflicting the luminaries
or itself afflicted, it denotes death in an asylum, hospital, or other
place of detention. Uranus in the 4th, in similar conditions, denotes
a sudden and remarkable death. Saturn similarly placed and aspected
shows death in exile, privation or great trouble. Mars in the 4th House
afflicting the luminaries or itself afflicted by other adverse planets,
denotes a violent death by gunshot or wound and in the midst of strife,
or on the field of battle.

Before any catastrophic death be predicted, it should be carefully
decided whether or not the death is compassed with uncommon and violent
indications, not that one need have fear of the mere going out or
coming into the world, but there is some choice of gates, and rather
than affright the weak-minded with a sinister judgment, it is better to
leave them to find their own way.




SECTION IV

THE STARS IN THEIR COURSES




CHAPTER I

THE TIME-MEASURE


The planets, in their motions after birth, come into certain relations
with the planets in the horoscope of birth, and also form aspects among
themselves owing to the diversities of their motions in the Zodiac.
In Astrological science there are two separate means of calculating
the time of events, but both methods consist of bringing the body of
one planet to the body or aspect of another, which process is called
"Directing," and the arc described by the moving body is called an "Arc
of Direction."

The first of these methods is the discovery of Claudius Ptolemy, the
famous mathematician and geographer, the author of the Syntaxis, as set
forth in his work the Tetrabiblos, or Four Books on the influence of
the Stars. This method had the support and confirmation of the great
Kepler. It has respect to the rising, setting, and meridian passage
of the planets after birth, whereby they are brought to the places or
aspects of the planets in the Radix (the Root), which is the horoscope
of birth.

The limits and nature of this work do not permit of a thorough
exposition of this method, which entails some little knowledge of
spherical trigonometry, but the reader who desires to perfect himself
therein is referred to the author's work, entitled "Prognostic
Astronomy." A facile application of the method is here given, by which
any one may, by the aid of the Tables of Houses, make certain of the
more important calculations by rule of thumb, and predict thence the
times of remarkable events.

The principle involved is this: The number of degrees which pass over
the meridian between the moment of birth and the rising or culminating
of a planet, will equal the number of years which must elapse from
birth until the influence of that planet becomes dominant.

Thus, if Jupiter at birth is coming to the meridian, that is to say,
if it be in the 10th, 11th, or 12th House, count the number of degrees
between the meridian and Jupiter, and in so many years from the time
of birth there will be an access of good fortune. Similarly, if Saturn
or other of the malefic planets be coming to the meridian, the number
of degrees between it and the Midheaven will indicate the age at which
troubles will abound.

Also, when the planets have passed the meridian, the measure is made
in the same way, by bringing the Midheaven to the place of the planet,
counting the degrees between the planet and Midheaven for the number of
years at which it will operate.

But the same and other planets may be directed to the horizon, by
taking the Table of Houses for the latitude of the birthplace (Sect.
I., chap. iii.) and finding therein under the column marked "Ascen."
(Ascendant) the longitude held by any of the planets. Observe then what
degree is on the Midheaven in the column marked 10 (10th House), and
count the number of degrees between this Midheaven and the Midheaven
at birth. The result will give the age at which the effects of such
planets will be experienced.

Thus, for a person born in or near Liverpool or in the same latitude,
suppose the Midheaven at birth to be in Scorpio 0, and Saturn to be
in the 2nd House in Aquarius 8 degrees. I wish to bring Saturn to
the horizon. In the Table of Houses I find that Aquarius 8 is on the
Ascendant when Sagittarius 9 is on the Midheaven, and I therefore count
from Scorpio 0 to Sagittarius 9. This gives the age of 39 years, and as
Saturn is in the 2nd House at birth, I say that at 39 years of age the
Subject would experience financial disaster, and because Saturn comes
then to the Ascendant, I also say there would be serious illness and
depression of spirits.

When planets are setting at birth they are brought to the opposition
of the Ascendant in a similar manner, only the opposite point of the
zodiac must be found in the Tables under the Ascendant. Thus, if Mars
were in the 7th House at birth in the 11th degree of Cancer, I find the
opposite point (Capricornus 11) under the column of the Ascendant, and
I note that Scorpio 19 is then on the Midheaven, so that from Scorpio
0 to Scorpio 19 gives 19 years, at which age the Subject would have a
serious illness due to inflammatory action in the stomach and probably
produced by overwork and worry, as indicated by the sign Cancer and
the planet Mars, or if there be indications of an accident, then an
accident by scalding with hot water or acids would be predicted.

Planets are brought to the opposition of the Midheaven by counting the
degrees which intervene between the longitude on the lower meridian at
birth and that held by the planet.

In all such directions the conjunctions of benefic planets are
advantageous when directed to the Midheaven or Ascendant, and the
conjunctions of the malefics are indicated of periods of bad fortune.
The oppositions are uniformly evil, whether the planet involved in the
direction be a benefic or malefic. (Sect. I., chap. iv.)

These are the directions of the planets to the two Significators,
the Midheaven and Ascendant. The Midheaven appertains to honours and
credit, while the Ascendant has relation to the personal and bodily
welfare and the general fortunes.

To direct the Midheaven or Ascendant to the other aspects of the
planets, such as the sextile, trine, semisquare or square, it is only
necessary to note the degrees in which these aspects fall and bring
them to the Midheaven or Ascendant as if the body of the planet were
itself there, and in the manner already indicated.

The Sun is directed after birth by its motion in the zodiac, which can
be found in the Ephemeris for the year of birth, and the aspects it
forms to the planets in the horoscope and in the daily progress should
be tabulated. In most Ephemerides they are already calculated, so
that the labour is considerably lightened. Each day after birth will
represent one year of life, the mean motion of the Sun being about
1 degree per day. All that is necessary, therefore, is to count the
number of days from birth to the date when the Sun forms an aspect, and
that will give the age at which the planet aspected will produce its
effects.

As the Sun goes through the zodiac the other bodies make progress
along with it, in which course they form aspects to the Midheaven,
Ascendant, the Sun and Moon in the horoscope of birth. These are called
"Secondary" directions, and in connection with the Sun's aspects after
birth, constituted the system in use among the Arabian astrologers.

Minor periods of good and bad fortune, subsidiary to the above
periodic influences, are taken from the Moon's progress after birth,
in which one day equals one year of life, and two hours equal one
month. These directions of the Moon afford a monthly prognosis of the
course of events, and are useful in the conduct of minor affairs in
life. When they are contrary to the general trend and import of the
periodic directions made to the Midheaven, Ascendant and Sun, they
act indifferently, and frequently produce only passing benefits or
annoyances; but when they are in agreement with the Primary Directions
cited above, then they accentuate and define the nature and time of
events. As if the Primaries be good and the Lunar directions evil,
then there will be a predominance of good fortune with some current
disturbances; but both being good there will be abundant success and
satisfaction; while if the Primaries be evil and the Lunar directions
good, the latter will serve only to moderate the effects for the time
being of the Primary evil indications.

An intelligent apercu of the principles of directing will greatly
enhance the value of any prognostications made from the horoscope of
birth, as it will enable the student to select those periods in the
life when the effects due to any planet are most likely to eventuate.
Thus, if Saturn be in the 2nd House at birth, it may be said that there
would follow some periods of great financial stress, and the rising of
Saturn by direction after birth would show the time when one, at all
events, of such periods would be experienced.

And here is the great fact upon which astrologers the world over
are prepared to stand or fall. If the planets have no effect in the
lives of men, their directions to the angles of the horoscope can
have no effect; but never was it found that a man had evil fortunes
at the period when the planet Jupiter was directed to the Midheaven
or Ascendant, or anything but bad fortune when Saturn was similarly
directed. The fact is there, and we cannot get away from it. The only
question is as to how far we can intelligently carry our investigations
beyond that point, and intelligibly convey our discoveries to the world
by their application to the affairs of daily life. The reader may judge
for himself from a perusal of these pages.

The directions being calculated and tabulated in order of their
occurrence, the time and general nature of the influences operating
in successive periods of the life will stand revealed. The particular
nature of the events indicated by the several directions may be known
from (_a_) the House in which the directed planet is situated; (_b_)
the Sign it occupies; and (_c_) the aspect it forms, considered in
relation to the nature of the planet. For example: If Uranus at birth
were in the 9th House and the sign Gemini, its direction to the
Midheaven would be the index of litigation in connection with writings,
publications, or means of transit; because the 9th House, among other
things, has relation to litigation and legal affairs, and Gemini (the
3rd House sign) to communications, writings, &c., while Uranus denotes
sudden and unexpected events, ruptures, alienations, and complexities.

So if Saturn were in the 6th House in the sign Aquarius, its direction
to the opposition of the Ascendant would indicate chills to the blood,
anemia, &c., constituting a serious illness with probability of low
fever; because the 6th House rules sickness, and Aquarius rules the
blood, while Saturn is the cause of chills, paucity, and impediments.

Thus the time and nature of events may be known with great certainty.




CHAPTER II

THE EFFECTS OF TRANSITS


Among the number of important indicators to which Astrologers refer in
making a forecast of concurrent events, there are the transits of the
planets over the places of the Significators at birth, the positions of
Eclipses, and those of the lunations.

The first of these chronocrators depends upon the revolutions of the
planets in their orbits. Each planet has a period in which it completes
its revolution in the heavens, in the course of which it passes the
places of the Sun, Moon, Midheaven, and Ascendant of the horoscope.
This passage over the radical Significators is technically termed
its "transit," and it will be found that such transits afford a very
precise and reliable source of prognostication, for the time of a
planet's transit is known in advance of its occurrence (see Sect. II.,
chap. iv.), and the effects of such transit are in exact terms of the
nature of the planet concerned. It is only necessary to add that the
Midheaven and the Sun have relation to the position and honour of the
Subject, while the Moon and Ascendant have relation to the personal
health and general fortunes. The Sun and Midheaven also signify the
father, and the Moon has general signification of the mother. Venus
signifies domestic and love affairs, the affections and sentiments;
while Mercury signifies the mental disposition. So Uranus in transit
over the place of Venus will give a love affair, a romantic attachment.
Mars over the place of Venus will engender passionate love. Saturn over
Venus will give disappointment or bereavement; and Neptune thereover
will bring entanglements and complications, with danger of being led
astray. Saturn over Mercury will produce melancholy and many errors of
judgment. Mars over the same planet will excite the mind and dispose
to impulse and unreasoning anger, quarrels and disputation. Uranus
over Mercury will render the mind wayward and headstrong, disposed to
erratic courses and egotistic methods. Neptune passing the place of
Mercury produces deceits, treacheries, and apprehension of impending
evil, a sense of espionage and ambush. It involves the mind in tortuous
and complicated schemes, and disposes to secrecy and wariness.

The transits of the major planets are of chief significance, and
their effects are rendered more weighty and lasting when at the time
of transit they are retrograde in the zodiac; while their stationary
positions on the places of the Significators have almost the same power
as Primary Directions.


Of Eclipses.

An Eclipse of the Sun or Moon falling on the place of any Significator
in the horoscope of birth is of a sinister import, and cannot be too
seriously considered. Falling on the Ascendant or the Moon they affect
the health and general fortunes very seriously, and only a series of
subsequent good directions can avail to restore the Subject to his
normal condition. On the Midheaven or the Sun, the honour and fortunes
may both be affected, and in the same serious degree. The Eclipses
falling on the places of the other planets will produce effects in
accord with the nature of those planets and the Houses they occupy. To
have any appreciable effect, the Eclipses must be within two degrees of
any of the radical positions, or of their opposition aspects.


Of Lunations.

The Lunations recur in the same part of the Ecliptic every nineteen
years. Considered in relation to the current indications they afford
the means of a monthly forecast of events. Thus, if the lunation for
the month falls on the place of Jupiter in the horoscope of birth, it
will produce good effects in that department of life which is governed
by the House in which Jupiter is situated; as if in the 11th, through
friends; in the 4th, through property or rental; in the 6th, through
servants and health; in the 8th, through a financial colleague, &c.

The effects of Lunations are subsidiary to the current Lunar
directions, and these in turn are subsidiary to the transits, and
the transits to the Primary Directions. By this it is not meant that
they are inoperative, nor that they fail to indicate the events of
the month, but their power and degree of influence is subject to the
greater influence of superior causes. And as a general observation
it may be affirmed that the less frequently any celestial position
occurs in a horoscope, the greater is its influence. This fact gives
to primary directions their great influence in the life, for they can
only occur once in a lifetime; and for the same reason Eclipses have a
major significance, for the same Eclipse only recurs after an interval
of 649 years. The transits of Neptune, of Uranus, of Saturn and Jupiter
and Mars follow in their order of frequency. Neptune has a revolution
of about 165 years, Uranus 84 years, Saturn 30 years, Jupiter 12 years,
and Mars 1-1/4 years.

Major effects must not therefore be referred to inferior causes, and
minor effects must not be referred to superior causes. In universal or
even national cataclysms, individual fortunes are submerged.




CHAPTER III

HOW TO SUMMARISE A HOROSCOPE


Before leaving the exposition of this subject, it may be of advantage
to the reader if I give some idea of the method to be pursued in the
complete handling of a horoscope.

First, then, erect the figure of birth, taking care to use the
Ephemeris of the year of birth, and also the correct Table of Houses
for the latitude of the place of birth.

Next proceed to attempt a description of the chief personal traits of
the Subject, following in succession with a well-considered judgment on
the constitution, hereditary tendencies, the health and pathological
predispositions, the mental traits and disposition, considering these
latter in relation to the state of health indicated. Then pass to a
consideration of the environing conditions of life; the financial
condition and outlook; the position in life; the occupation; prospects
and conditions of marriage; of progeny. Judge next concerning voyages
and journeys. Finish with a statement regarding the predominance of
friends or enemies, and select dates by Solar positions, as already
instructed. In cases where it is not objected to, an approximation may
be made to the time and nature of death.

Throughout the whole of this judgment, the periods when these predicted
effects will come into force should be made by reference to the rising,
setting, and meridian passage of the planets, the solar aspects, and
transits.

Care should be taken to weigh justly and impartially the evidence set
before you in the figure of the heavens for birth. Major importance
should be given to those planets which are in angles, and those which
are in elevation, for the nearer a planet may be to the Midheaven, the
greater is its influence for good or ill, according to its nature and
aspect.

Read what you see, not what you imagine should be the destiny of an
individual. If you are in complete ignorance of his person, position,
and environment, so much the better. If you follow carefully the
various rules which are contained in this book, you may at first make
some errors of judgment, but as you become familiar with the task,
even these errors will become few and far between, and in the end the
language of the horoscope will become so intelligible and clear that it
will interpret itself, and the whole trend and potentiality for good
or ill of any birth-figure will force itself upon you in just the same
way as when a man walks into your presence with his character clearly
stamped upon his face, so that you have only to look and know.

Having become proficient in the judgment of birth-figures, you will
do well to proceed to a closer study of the mathematics of astrology,
making yourself proficient in the various methods of directing, so that
you may at any time refine upon your general prognostics, and make
predictions which are clear, sharp, and to the point.

Undoubtedly there is a modicum of intuitive perception at work in
the judgment of any horoscope, which will enable you to seize upon
the small details and exact pointing of any matter, and this perhaps
constitutes the whole difference between the rule of thumb worker and
the inspirational reasoning of the intuitive worker. The one exhausts
the books and the other embellishes them. It is so with science in
every department. The books will take you up to a certain point of
proficiency, and a strict regard for the formulæ will keep you within
the bounds of safety. But if you are ever to make a discovery or
become a recognised exponent of any science, you must be naturally
gifted with what is called the "scientific imagination," another name
for intuition. But at no point does true intuition part company with
exact reasoning. There is no lesion. The one is an extension of the
other. It is the higher reason, which argues from the known to the
unknown. And the Astrologer is in this respect as the poet, "born, not
made." But a moment's reflection will suffice to convince you that the
more facile you may become with the book-learning and technique of
Astrology, the more you will leave the intuition free to act. When a
lad is struggling with his multiplication tables, his appreciation of
the binomial theorem or the differential calculus cannot be said to
amount to much. And, in the same way, a person who is stuffing down the
Alphabet of Astrology cannot be expected to intuit anything concerning
the potential of the Sun's direction to the quadrature of Saturn.




CHAPTER IV

HOW TO BECOME A SUCCESSFUL ASTROLOGER


I take it that nobody nowadays can afford to fritter away time in the
study of subjects which are not likely to become a source of benefit
to himself and others. If there be such people among my readers, which
I consider unlikely, I may dismiss them offhand with the remark that
they will never become successful astrologers, for the first word of
practical astrology is Utility. If the science had not its practical
application to the affairs of everyday life, if its principles
contained no word of assurance and hope for the myriad toilers of
this world, no word of admonition for the self-indulgent parasites of
modern social life, if, in short, it did not make for the betterment
of human life and thought, it would never have attracted the attention
of Aristotle, Cicero, Galen, Claudius Ptolemy, Thales, and others of
the old world, and such men as Bacon, Cardan, Archbishop Usher, Naibod,
Mercator, Ashmole, Kenelm Digby, Sir Christopher Heydon, Dryden, Dr.
John Butler, Sir George Wharton, Vincent Wing, George Witchel, Tycho
Brahe, Kepler, and Flamstead of more recent biography. Indeed, in
whatever age or country we may elect to make our inquiries concerning
Astrology, there are to be found a host of intelligent and even
illustrious advocates in every department of life and learning. Suffice
it to say that the modern student of this most ancient of all sciences
is at all times in very good company.

Let it first be understood that there is an object to be attained in
the study of Astrology, and that the pursuit of it in the gratification
of an idle curiosity alone will inevitably entail the waste of time
which invariably attaches to idleness of all descriptions, and we may
then profitably consider whether or not the subject is worth the labour
which it will demand from the man who has something to do in the world
and little enough time in which to do it. These are stressful times,
and we have to be economical in our efforts. We have strength enough to
carry us through, but neither strength enough to thresh the wind nor
time enough to fish in puddles.

What, then, does Astrology offer to the patient worker, the man who
would become a successful Astrologer?

First and foremost it will enable him to gain an insight into
individual motive and character which no other science can possibly
afford. It will enable him to know himself, his own strength and
weakness, and so fit him to deal harmoniously and justly with others.
It will enhance his opportunities to the extent that he is able to
foresee and make use of all benefic influences operating through his
own environment. It will give him timely warning of his approach to
the quicksands and pitfalls which occur in his passage through life.
He will discern his special physical weaknesses, and the times of his
predisposition to sickness, the nature thereof, and the precautions
which are necessary. He will know whom to cultivate and whom to avoid,
and in selecting a partner in business or a wife for his home, he will
be guided by a foreknowledge of evils to be avoided and of good things
to be gained. He will choose his path in life with the confidence
that it is for him the line of least resistance and therefore that of
greatest progress. He will not become obsessed by ambitions beyond his
power to achieve. He will learn the power of adaptation to environment,
and thereby effect his work in the world with the least possible
friction and waste of force. He will know when to make provision
against sickness, accident, and death. He will not invest capital where
interest is not to be gained. He will see the end from the beginning.
It may not make him a brilliant success in the world, but it will
assuredly save him from being a failure. He will find causes for
inexplicable things, and his mind will rest content in the knowledge
hat while he is working out the highest potentialities of his own
horoscope, the major problems and intricacies of life are not of his
making or needful of his solving. And finally, when his time comes to
"shuffle off this mortal coil," he will be prepared, and will know that
it is the will of Heaven, expressed and determined from the moment of
his birth. Rightly employed, Astrology cannot fail to improve the man
who makes of it a serious study, fitting him to be of greater use to
others and of higher service to the race at large.

But to become a successful Astrologer he must study patiently for
several years, testing each statement that is made in the books by
reference to his own and several other horoscopes. He must be able
to erect a figure of the Heavens with mathematical accuracy for any
given time and place, work out directions by the use of the sphere or
trigonometrical tables, and have a competent knowledge of the motions
and periods of the various planetary bodies. When thus satisfied in his
own mind that Astrology is a dependable science, and that he is capable
of demonstrating it under test conditions, he must be generous in the
use of it. Here and there he will find one who is opposed to the belief
that the stars have any influence in human affairs. Let him not waste
logic with such a man, but go straight to the task of convincing him by
an appeal to facts.

For preference, select a period when the directional influences are
such as seem likely to hit the sceptic with considerable force, define
the event, make a careful calculation of the time of its fulfilment,
and put them on paper, which, being yet unread by the man of
Common-sense, should be placed under cover, sealed, and endorsed to be
opened only after a certain date.

Now a man who has been hammered rather severely and in quite an
unexpected manner, is usually open to conviction of truth when he
finds that the nature and date of his disaster have been accurately
foretold. Being a man of "common-sense" and not of intuition, he will
probably think that the Astrologer might even have saved him from
the consequences of his own lack of foresight. So indeed might the
Astrologer have done had he taken the management of affairs from the
beginning; but to step in half-way to arrest causes which are already
in operation and charged with inevitable effects, is requiring too much
of any man short of a Prime Minister!

There are certain things which even the most astute deductive reasoner
cannot foresee, and these are the points that should be utilised by the
Astrologer who seeks to convince others of the truth of his science. A
man cannot reason from his doorstep to a street accident. If he could
he would avoid it. All men are not subject to accidents, however.
But almost all are subject to bereavements, losses, sicknesses, and
changes of fortune. Those are the points which the Astrologer intent
on proselytising, usually makes use of. But events need not be in
futurity to carry conviction. If it can be shown that by mathematical
calculations the events of the past can be recited with precision
and exactness, it is evident to the meanest intellect that nothing
hinders from an extension of such calculations into the future. And
once convinced of the reliability of such claims to foreknowledge, the
practical man of the world is not slow to avail himself of its uses.

But Astrology is not exhausted in the study of individual horoscopes,
for there are other departments of this extensive science.
The influence of the planets upon the weather, as embodied in
Astro-meteorology; the rise and fall of Empires, political changes, the
outbreak of wars, of revolutions, of epidemics, as defined by State
Astrology so much in repute among the Oriental rulers; the occurrence
of tidal waves, earthquakes, and other seismic phenomena, all form a
part of the complete equipment of the practical Astrologer.

It would be superfluous to recite here the numerous and strikingly
accurate forecasts which have been made by modern exponents of the
science, but it is only right to say that they reflect considerable
credit upon their authors, for the above-mentioned departments of
astrological learning are by no means in the same efficient state as
Genethliacal Astrology, to an outline of which this work is devoted.
Anciently it was otherwise, and even in the East at this day they hold
some secrets of traditional knowledge, concerning which they are unduly
mysterious and of which we have only the evidence afforded by more
exact prediction upon certain points.

Prejudice and Ignorance are the twin giants which bar the path of the
world's progress to-day, even as they have ever done. Step by step they
have been beaten back, baffled by the light of Reason, harassed by the
arrows of Truth. The world is redeeming its ancient heritage. All that
is now required to establish the paramount truth of Astrology as a
science is an impartial and thorough investigation, preferably at the
hands of scientific men, of its methods and principles. Not that the
truth is to be ratified at the hands of modern scientists, seeing that
their own teaching constitutes a mere shifting orthodoxy, liable at
any moment to undergo a fundamental change in theory by the discovery
of a single new fact--but that to such men rightly belongs the duty
of disproving the claims of Astrology to be considered as a science,
for it is a fact to be regretted that certain members of their body
have written against the subject in a spirit of prejudice and without
adducing any data in support of their contention, which ill becomes any
man of scientific pretensions and is above all things detrimental to
the cause of Truth.




CHAPTER V

A POPULAR ILLUSTRATION


In order to summarise and illustrate the principles which have been
enunciated in the course of this work, I shall avail myself of the
horoscope of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, who was born on the 8th of July,
1836, at Highbury, the time of birth being stated to have been at about
2.30 in the morning. Calculations have since enabled us to fix the
exact time of birth as at 2 h. 36 m. a.m. I subjoin the horoscopical
figure for that time, the calculation of which is as follows:--

                                                 H. M. S.
    Midheaven in R.A. at Noon 7th July, 1836     7  1  58
    Add time elapsed since                      14 36   0
        Equation for 14h. 33m. at 10 secs.          2  25
                                                ---------
    Midheaven in Right Ascension at Birth       21 40  23
                                                =========


The Constitution.

Born under the sign Gemini, with Mercury rising in the sign Cancer, the
Sun near the conjunction with Jupiter and in close sextile to the Moon,
there is little doubt that the late Colonial Secretary is by nature
gifted with an excellent constitution. The sextile of the luminaries is
a powerful co-ordinator, and whenever sickness supervenes there will be
a speedy recovery. The semisquare aspect of Mars, while disposing to
gouty affections of the hands and feet, will contribute vital energy
and power to throw off diseases, while at the same time predisposing to
accidents and wounds to the right shoulder or clavicle.

[Illustration]

The rising sign gives nervous energy and enormous capacity for work,
which is due to high nervous tension supported by a sound vitality. The
only hereditary predisposition is that indicated by Mars, which induces
to fevers, and gouty affections due to acidity.


The Health.

The Moon is strong in the sign Taurus, but not particularly well placed
in the 12th House. It has, moreover, the square aspects of Neptune and
Venus from fixed signs. These indications point to functional disorders
of the heart, throat and excretory system. On the other hand, there
are the good aspects of the Sun, Jupiter and Uranus to counteract
these adverse tendencies, and it is certain that strong recuperative
powers together with a normally good co-ordination of functions would
induce a speedy recovery from any illness to which he may be liable.
Considerable immunity from sickness of all sorts may therefore be
predicated.


Character and Disposition.

The majority of the planets being in Cardinal signs, with three
planets (including the Moon) in Fixed signs, indicates a character
that is energetic, ambitious, active, sharp, ingenious, lively, and
persevering; capable of cutting out a line in life for himself and
making headway against obstacles; disposed to ride roughshod over
the weaknesses and prejudices of those who oppose him; gifted with a
pioneer spirit, incisive manner, and disposed at times to effect his
ends regardless of the feelings and opinions of others. At the same
time there is sufficient patience, method, caution, and watchfulness
to make this extreme definition of purpose very effective. Laborious,
firm (at times obstinate), systematic, and self-reliant, he is capable
of waiting for opportunities. But finally he carries his purpose with a
_tour de force_.

That which he lacks is adaptability, suavity, and ability to enter into
the feelings of others. He is too ambitious to be self-centred, but yet
too intent to be sympathetic.

The rising of Mercury in trine aspect to Saturn and Uranus gives
considerable mental capacity, a wide grasp of facts, a well-informed,
apt and business-like mind; some originality, constructiveness, and
power of marshalling facts and figures; patience, caution, and secrecy.
There is not much imagination, and the sympathies are not wide. His
methods and actions are governed by literal fact and mathematical
certainty. He is an omnivorous devourer of the accessible. He takes the
small fish by the handful and makes a meal of them; but he leaves the
ponderous whales for those of greater imagination and more leisurely
habit.

The quadrature of Mars to Uranus will induce momentary outbursts
of temper and some irritability of nature, but the character I am
delineating is not such as can easily be played upon, for it is
remarkably lacking in emotional susceptibility. Nevertheless, the
inspirational faculty is by no means absent, and the presence of
Neptune in the 9th House in trine to the rising Mercury, is an index of
considerable inventive genius, extreme range of mental perception, and
telescopic discernment of future events. Venus in the 3rd House shows
some artistic tastes and fancies, considerable appreciation of art and
culture, a fondness for flowers, bright lights, &c. But dominant above
all are the two angular influences of Uranus and Mercury, which render
the mind mathematical and precise, commercial, apt, business-like,
energetic, and eminently magnetic.


Finance.

The position of the Sun in conjunction with Jupiter in the sign Cancer,
in sextile to the Moon, is the index of a high fortune and means
exceeding a competence. It is here worthy of note that Cancer, which
in this horoscope holds the Sun, Jupiter, and Mercury, is the ruling
sign of South Africa, with which Colony Mr. Chamberlain's fortunes have
been for a long time so intimately associated. It is also worthy of
note that both Cecil Rhodes and Barney Barnato were born on the same
day of the year, the 5th of July, with the Sun in the 14th degree of
Cancer. In the former case the Sun was conjoined with Moon and Venus,
in sextile to Uranus and trine to Neptune, while in the latter case the
Sun was in trine to Jupiter. In regard to Mr. Chamberlain's horoscope,
it will be observed that Jupiter, which holds such effective power for
increase in the 2nd House, is also the ruler of the 7th, and it is to
be remembered that all partnerships, commercial or social, which he
has contracted have so far proved highly satisfactory from a merely
monetary point of view. Further, the Moon is affected with the good
aspect of the Sun in the 2nd House, which is a further indication that
on a purely financial basis Mr. Chamberlain is a man worth going into
partnership with.


Position.

All the planets except Neptune and Saturn are rising, and this at once
indicates a man ambitious of independence and honours, one who is
confessedly a candidate for responsibility.

Uranus in the Midheaven and close to the meridian indicates that
association with civic and governmental bodies in which Mr. Chamberlain
has rendered himself so conspicuous a figure, and whereas the trine
aspect of Mercury in the Ascendant to Uranus in the Midheaven and
the sextile of the Moon to Uranus also are sure indications of a
wide popularity, the square aspect of Mars to Uranus from the 12th
House, will not fail to engender many veiled enmities, machinations,
and inimical plots, which have for their object the overthrow of Mr.
Chamberlain's prestige, and which, failing, will find expression in
vituperative abuse and bitter animosity. But those who understand the
virtue of the orientality of planets in a horoscope will retain their
confidence in Mr. Chamberlain's ability to hold his own against all
opponents.

It will be observed that the direction of the Ascendant to the place
of Uranus in the horoscope coincides with the age of Mr. Chamberlain
at the outbreak of hostilities in South Africa, while the direction of
Midheaven opposition Saturn coincides with the progress of the Boer
War. Did space permit it would be possible to adduce a long list of
directional arcs coinciding with the time and nature of all the more
important epochs in Mr. Chamberlain's career. The student is invited to
make some test of this matter by the aid of the rules already given in
these pages.


Marriage.

Mr. Chamberlain has been thrice married. It will be observed that not
only is there a double-bodied sign on the cusp of the 7th House, but
the Moon also applies to both the Sun and Jupiter in the sign Cancer.
(See Sect. III., chap. 8.) The aspect of the Moon being benefic to
both the Sun and Jupiter, the marital state would be both harmonious
and fortunate. It is, of course, well known that Mr. Chamberlain has,
from a merely worldly point of view, married most advantageously. This
observation may be called "wise after the event," but I would observe
that this geniture preceded my judgment of it, and the rules from which
I judge are to be found in the Tetrabiblos of Ptolemy, written in the
second century, and since tested and found reliable by successive
astrologers during some seventeen centuries. Saturn's aspect to
Jupiter, the ruler of the 7th House, and the Moon's quadrature to Venus
must be held accountable for the successive bereavements which have
disturbed the conjugal life in this case.


Progeny.

The position of Saturn in the 5th House, and the affliction of Venus
by Neptune and the Moon, will serve to account, in connection with
the marriage conditions, for the small family which has been born to
Mr. Chamberlain, for observe that Venus is the ruler, jointly with
Mercury, of the 5th House, while Saturn is in the 5th and ruler of
the 8th House. The same positions and aspects threaten to curtail the
succession.

The position of Mercury, joint ruler of the 5th, in the sign Cancer,
and just about to rise in the horoscope, promises honours and
distinctions to the first-born.


Travelling.

The Moon and Mars are cadent in the Horoscope, and Mercury, the
"winged messenger" (symbol of the trading-ship), is rising. These are
indications of many journeys and changes and constant unrest. But
fixed signs being on the cusps of the 3rd and 9th Houses, and the Moon
also in a fixed sign, will suffice to account for the fact that Mr.
Chamberlain is not a great long-distance traveller. Cancer and Leo
holding the benefics and the Sun also well aspected in Cancer, the Moon
being in Taurus, shows at once that France, South Africa, Holland,
Scotland, and Ireland are parts of the world in which the operations of
Mr. Chamberlain would meet with success, if it be not superfluous to
detail specific territories in face of the abundant evidence of general
success which this horoscope affords.


Friends and Enemies.

It was the boast of Bismarck that he was the "best-hated man in
Europe," and it would be strange indeed if Mr. Chamberlain had passed
through life and attained so prominent a position without incurring the
enmity, or arousing the envy and malice of a considerable number of
individuals. Nevertheless, there are only two aspects in this horoscope
which seem to point to any sort of trouble from such causes. The points
are those of Neptune, which afflicts both the Moon and Venus, and of
Mars which afflicts Uranus in the Midheaven and the Sun in the 2nd
House.

By referring these two points to the Ecliptic we find they correspond
to the Sun's position on or about the 24th of May, and the 26th of
January, and I shall leave the reader to look up his Almanac and find
the individuals (illustrious they must needs be to find chronicle in
Whittaker) who were capable of filling the requirements of the case.

As to friends, Mr. Chamberlain should lack nothing. With the Moon in
sextile to the Sun and Jupiter, the ruler of the 11th House, in the
same benefic relations with the Moon, he would always be able to count
upon a strong adherence, and the only adverse indication in this matter
is that Mars, part ruler of the 11th House, holds the 12th House in
square aspect to Uranus in the Midheaven. This would be interpreted
to mean that some of his friends will be disposed to become his
enemies, and to militate, although ineffectually, against his credit
and position. Why ineffectually? Because Mercury, the ruler of the
Ascendant and prime significator of Mr. Chamberlain, is angular and
well aspected, while Mars is weak and afflicted by Uranus which is in
elevation above it.


Conclusion.

Let it not be thought that the fame and position which Mr. Chamberlain
has attained in the political world is due entirely to the benefic
position of the principal planets in his horoscope of birth.
Opportunity is not everything. The ability to use it counts for much,
and only a man of exceptional industry, firmness, and decision, could
have won for himself such peculiar distinction; and only a man of
singular faculty could have sustained his position in the face of so
much determined opposition. It will doubtless be a matter of extreme
interest to the student of this horoscope, as to every one interested
in the political situation of to-day, to observe the concurrent
influences at work in the year 1904-5. Mr. Chamberlain attained his
sixty-eighth birthday anniversary on the 8th of July, 1904, and by
adding that number of degrees to the 22nd degree of Aquarius we obtain
Taurus 0 as the point which has attained the meridian by "direction."
This is called the Progressed Midheaven. Referring this point of the
Zodiac to the places of the planets at birth, it is observed that the
Midheaven is approaching the sextile aspect of Mercury, having recently
passed the opposition of Saturn, and having attained that aspect in
1905, it passes in 1908 to the sextile of Uranus, the planet which
holds the greatest elevation in the horoscope of birth. The Ascendant
under the Midheaven of Taurus 0 is Leo 16° 28´, which is the Progressed
Ascendant for the year 1904. It is in semisquare aspect to Mercury, and
is the occasion of many anxieties, worries, and annoyances, and some
journeys by water. It also indicates some derangement of the health
due to nervous strain, and affecting the stomach (ruled by Cancer).
The Sun is directed in similar manner to the 24th degree of the sign
Virgo, where it meets the sextile aspect of Jupiter in the 2nd House,
in the sign of its exaltation, Cancer. This gives access of good
fortune, increase of honor and prestige, and as Jupiter rules the 11th
House, many adherents and supporters. But being also in semisquare to
Venus, Mr. Chamberlain is in danger of losing a brother or other near
male relative. The Moon by the same measure is within 4 degrees of the
place of Jupiter, again marking the year 1908 as one of exceptional
advantage, and in July of that year Jupiter passes over the Progressed
Ascendant.

                               * * * * *

During the year 1904 Saturn has been close to the Midheaven of the
radical horoscope, being in Aquarius 21, and stationary therein,
during the month of June. In March, and again in October, it transits
the opposition of the Progressed Ascendant in Aquarius 16, while in
February, June, and December Uranus is in transit over the opposition
of the radical Ascendant in Sagittarius 28° 16´.

                               * * * * *

In 1905, Saturn will transit the Midheaven in the horoscope of
birth, and in the summer of the same year Mars will be Stationary in
opposition to the place of the Moon at birth. Both these periods will
be fraught with cares and anxieties, and the latter influence will
act detrimentally on the health, disposing to attacks of gout and
inflammatory action in the system.

                               * * * * *

But while the approaching and concurrent Primary directions are of a
highly benefic nature, there will be no hint of a breakdown either in
health or reputation, and it needs only the additional good influence
of a transit or Secondary Lunar direction to carry Mr. Chamberlain at
full swing to the summit of popular esteem and political power.

The curious who seek for coincidences will not be surprised and may be
gratified to note that Merx, the root of the name of Mercury, signifies
trade, and that the planet Mercury is rising in this horoscope of Mr.
Chamberlain, who won great distinction for himself as President of the
Board of Trade. Those who in more earnest vein seek for causes will do
well to trace the transits of the major planets through this horoscope
over the places of the Significators, the Sun, Moon, Midheaven, and
Ascendant at all the important epochs in the life of the late Colonial
Secretary. The working out of the more important directional arcs
for the same period I can safely leave to the reader whose desire to
thoroughly test the claims of Astrology has been sufficiently aroused
by the perusal of these pages. It is at all times easier to dispute
than to disprove, and this apparently is the reason for so much that is
said, and so little that is shown, against Astrology.

As to the _modus operandi_ of planetary influence I conceive that
the brain cells are infilled with a nervous pabulum of such delicate
nature as to be capable of responding to the finer etheric vibrations
instituted by the planets; that the electrostatic condition of the
earth's atmosphere at the moment of birth determines the particular
mode or modes of vibration to which the individual brain is
syntonically responsive; and I could, did space permit, immediately
adduce hundreds of instances to show that whenever the same positions
or planetary aspects recur in the heavens as were in existence at
the moment of a birth, the individual immediately responds to the
excitation, and gives instant evidence of such excitation by actions in
agreement with the nature of the planets involved.




CHAPTER VI

PLANETARY PERIODS, ETC.


We now come to the point where it will be necessary to explain more
fully the various elements with which so far the reader has only been
dealing in a more or less mechanical way. It is, of course, of first
importance that the student of Astrology should have a correct method,
and this has been given as fully as space will permit in the preceding
pages. But it is also necessary that one should know why he is doing
a thing, as well as how to do it. Henry Ward Beecher once said that
if a man turned soil with a spade knowing why he did it, the work was
more effectively done than if he did not know. For this reason it will
be convenient for the student to have a general view of the cosmical
elements that he employs in his calculations and of the factors that
enter into his consideration when studying a horoscope.

For purposes of calculation, the astronomer regards the planets as
moving around the Sun in circular orbits at a uniform rate, and the
positions thus obtained are called the mean longitudes of the planets.
But it is known that the orbit of a planet answers to the functions of
an ellipse, of which the Sun is presumed to occupy one of the foci.
Then it becomes necessary to correct the Mean Longitude of the planet
by an equation which is called the Centre equation.

Let us make this quite clear. The circular orbit supposed in the
first instance is what may be called the Mean Orbit of the planet,
as compared with its true orbit, which is elliptical. Similarly, the
motion of the planet in the circular orbit is called the Mean Motion,
as compared with the true motion, which is variable, being quickest at
the perihelion and slowest at the aphelion.

The difference between the Mean longitude and the True longitude is
determined by the Anomaly, which is the distance of the planet from its
Aphelion, or farthest distance from the Sun. The anomaly is thus L-A,
i. e., longitude minus aphelion.

But it will be seen that ellipses may be of greater or less
eccentricity, and the equation to centre depends on the eccentricity.
This may need a word of explanation. Suppose a circular orbit. Draw the
two diameters at right angles to one another; they are of equal length.
Now suppose another figure in which the one diameter is longer than
the other. The circumference of this figure will be an ellipse. The
greater diameter is called the Major Axis, and the diameter at right
angles to it is the Minor Axis. The proportion of one to the other axis
determines the amount of eccentricity. Twice the eccentricity gives
the equation to centre, and to reduce this to degrees and minutes of
a circle it has to be multiplied by the chord of 60 degrees, which is
57°·29578. This gives the maximum equation to centre when the planet
is 3 signs or 90 degrees from its aphelion, and therefore on the Minor
Axis.

The eccentricity of the various planets may be here stated: Mercury,
0.2055; Mars, 0.0931; Jupiter, 0.0482; Saturn, 0.9562; Uranus, 0.9467;
Earth, 0.0168; Venus, 0.0068. These quantities undergo a gradual
change. Thus it is found that Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury are increasing
the eccentricity of their orbits, while Venus, the Earth, and Saturn
are reducing it. The orbit of Venus is now almost circular, and it
affords an example of the perfect astronomical paradigm.

Thus by the mean motions and the equation to centre the true longitudes
of the planets in their heliocentric orbits are obtained. But inasmuch
as the orbits of the planets do not lie in the same plane as the Sun,
but cross its apparent path at various angles of inclination, a further
equation is due to reduce the orbital longitudes of the planets to the
ecliptic.

To further reduce these true longitudes into their geocentric
equivalents, i. e., as seen from the Earth's centre, we have to employ
the angle of Parallax, which is the angle of difference as seen from
two different points in space. This will vary according to the relative
distances of the bodies from one another. The Moon's longitude is
always taken geocentrically. When approximate longitudes are required,
the employment of a mean vector, which is equal to half the minor axis
of the planet, is found convenient. For the convenience of astronomical
students I may here give the constant logarithms of the values of the
tangent, which, being added to the logarithm of the tangent of half the
distance of the planet from the Sun in longitude, will give the tangent
of the complement.


LOGARITHMS

Neptune, 9.97107; Uranus, 9.95479; Saturn, 9.90858; Jupiter, 9.83114;
Mars, 9.32457; Venus, 9.20812; Mercury, 9.63210.

To these add the bog, tangent of half the angle between the planet and
Sun, taken by heliocentric longitude, which call A. Call the result B.
For major planets add A and B, and for minor planets subtract B from A.
In either case the result will be the angle of longitude between the
planet and the Sun as seen from the Earth, and hence its geocentric
longitude may be known.

But a more convenient method of obtaining the approximate longitudes
of the planets geocentrically is by means of the Planetary Geocentric
periods. Thus Uranus has a period of 84 years, after which it returns
to the same longitude on the same day of the year and will be further
advanced in its orbit by 1° 5´. Saturn has a period of 59 years, after
which it comes to the same place in the zodiac and will be further
advanced by 1° 53´. Jupiter has a period of 83 years, when it is found
to be only 4´ advanced upon its former longitude. Mars' period is 79
years plus an advance of 2° 4´. Mercury's period is also 79 years,
and its advance is 5° 32´. Venus has a period of 8 years, when it is
further advanced in the zodiac by 1° 32´.

For the calculation of the approximate geocentric longitude of the
major planets these periods are very useful, but are of less value in
regard to the minor planets Venus and Mercury.

Suppose I want the longitude of Uranus in the year A. D. 827. I have
its longitude on the first of January, 1912, in Capricorn 28° 17´.
Then 1912-827 gives 1,085 years, which being divided by the period of
Uranus (84 years), yields 12 periods and 77 years. The increment for 1
period being 1° 5´, that for 12 will be 13°, and 77-84ths of 1° 5´ will
be another degree, making 14 degrees. As the date is anterior, this
amount must be subtracted from its longitude on the first of January,
A. D. 827, and in effect we obtain Capricorn 14 degs. 17 mins. as the
longitude of Uranus on the first of January, 827, as seen from the
Earth.

For the purpose of determining the effects, if any, due to the presence
of a planet in its Aphelion, Perihelion, or Node, the following values
are given for the year 1800 A. D.:

      Planet.      Aphelion.    Perihelion.        Node.
                   S.   °   ´    S.   °   ´      S.  °   ´
    Mercury         8  14  21     2  14  21      1  15  57
    Venus          10   8  36     4   8  36      2  14  52
    Mars            5   2  23    11   2  23      1  18   1
    Jupiter         6  11   8     0  11   8      3   8  24
    Saturn          8  29   4     2  29   4      3  21  57
    Uranus         11  17  21     5  17  21      2  12  51
    Neptune         7  12  22     2  12  22      4   9  35

The longitudes of the Aphelia are increased in 100 years by the
following quantities: Neptune, 1° 25´; Uranus, 1° 28´; Saturn, 1° 50´;
Jupiter, 1° 35´; Mars, 1° 52´; Venus, 1° 43´; Mercury, 1° 34´. These
quantities are additive for years after 1800, and subtractive for years
before that epoch.

In the present state of astronomical science it is not certain that
these values are absolutely correct. Calculated from the Tables of
Kepler, the differences are only slight, but still sufficient to make
considerable error in testing for exact conjunctions or ingresses.

Lilly, who predicted the Great Plague and Fire of London some years
previous to the event from the ingress of the Aphelion of Mars to the
sign Virgo, evidently made use of the Rudolphine Tables constructed
by Tycho and Kepler, and according to these the ingress took place in
1654, while according to more modern Tables it did not take place until
1672. It is probable, however, that the positions of the Aphelia here
given will be sufficiently close for all practical purposes.

A word or two may now be said regarding the periodic conjunctions of
the planets.

As will be seen from the periods given, five periods of Jupiter are
nearly equal to two of Saturn. It is found that the two planets form
their conjunctions every 20 years. Thus there was a conjunction in
Virgo in 1861, another in Taurus in 1881, and another in Capricornus in
1901. The next will be in Virgo in 1921. The two planets are thus now
forming their successive conjunctions in the Earthly Tripicity; but in
1981 will make their mutation conjunction by falling together in the
Airy sign Libra.

Uranus and Jupiter form their conjunctions every 14 years. Thus there
was a conjunction in Sagittarius in 1900, and there will be another in
Aquarius in 1914, another in Aries in 1928, and so on.

The conjunctions of Neptune with the other major planets are
necessarily in terms of the periods of the latter, those of Neptune
and Uranus being very infrequent, while those with Jupiter will be
proportionately more frequent. For the period of Jupiter is only
12 years, while Neptune remains in the same sign for 15 years. The
conjunction of Jupiter and Neptune in Cancer in 1907 will be followed
by another in Leo in 1919, and this again by another in Virgo in 1932.

Obviously, if the planets by their transits effect anything whatsoever,
the double transit of major planets must have a correspondingly greater
effect. The careful student of Astrology will institute a number of
tests in order to find what effects are due to the combined action of
the planets when in conjunction at transit, and also when in opposition
or quadrature. The chief points to be noticed in connection with the
transits of the planets are the Midheaven, Ascendant, and the places of
the Sun and Moon, as already mentioned in Chapter II of this section.

The ancients also included the places of the Moon's Nodes, and it
is usually found that the transit of the South Node over any of the
Significators is attended by unfortunate results.

With these observations as a general guide to the cosmical factors
involved in the planetary motions, the reader will be able to take a
more intelligent interest in the foundations of his study than is the
usual case from the pursuit of the subject by rule-of-thumb methods.

When we come to the consideration of the Moon as a cosmical factor we
are face to face with one of the most difficult and evasive problems.
For many centuries astronomers grappled with this inconstant factor
with small success, and at the present day the problems attaching
to the vagaries of lunar motion are in anything but a satisfactory
condition. Prior to the time of Ptolemy nothing was known of the Moon
except that it had a certain mean motion and formed its syzygies at
definite periods, the mean values of which were very closely known.
But certainly nothing was known regarding the inequalities of motion
which are found to exist. Ptolemy discovered the equation due to the
action of the Sun upon the Moon in its orbit. This is called the
Evection. Tycho later discovered that a further equation was due to the
disturbance caused by the Sun along the vector. Both these equations
were employed by Kepler. But of these, later astronomers have added
one after another equation, going so far as to employ the action due
to Venus and Jupiter, while ignoring that due to the action of the
other planets upon the Moon. Buckhardt, whose formulae were used in
the calculation of the Nautical Almanac for many years, employs no
less than 37 equations of the Moon's mean longitude. Indeed, the whole
business has become farcical. The fact is that only three of these
equations are necessary in order to obtain the Moon's true place in
the ecliptic at any time, and for the syzygy only one equation is
necessary. The trouble has arisen from the fact that the eccentricity
of the Moon's orbit has been wrongly estimated, and most of these
equations now employed by astronomers are effectual only in correcting
this false estimate. Kepler gives the maximum equation to centre as
4° 59´ 59´´, while modern astronomers have given it as 6° 18´ 28´´.
Neither of these is quite correct, though Kepler is much nearer the
truth.

Another problem in connection with the Moon that has puzzled
astronomers for a long time and is still in the region of experimental
science is what is known as the Secular equation. It is found that by
taking the present mean motion of the Moon and applying the various
equations, found necessary to bring the calculations into line with
observations of the Moon's position in the zodiac, a considerable
difference is found to exist between the calculated place of the Moon
and its recorded position at the time of ancient eclipses. According to
our modern Tables, ancient eclipses happened sooner than they should
have done, or, in other words, the Moon was more advanced in its orbit
than our Tables require. The inference is that the Moon was formerly
moving quicker in a smaller orbit than now, or conversely, the Moon
is now receding and getting farther from the Earth. Consequently its
action on the tides must be diminishing, and also its action on the
equatorial mass of the Earth, which is considered to be the chief
factor in the production of what is called the Precession of the
Equinoxes. Yet whereas by one statement the disturbance due to the Moon
is diminishing, another statement shows that the Precession of the
Equinoxes is increasing! =Voila le debacle.=

All these anomalies and contradictions are due, as I shall show in my
new Tables and Thesis, to the importation of false factors into the
problem of the Moon's motion, which, in fact, is extremely simple,
perfectly regular, and affected only by its anomaly or distance from
the aphelion and, where the time equation is employed, by the increase
of radius. Jupiter and Venus have no more action on the Moon than
have Mars and Saturn, in fact none at all, and the only body that has
any action upon the lunar orb is the Sun, which it exerts indirectly
through its action on the Earth.

These problems need not, however, vex the minds of the student of
Astrology. It is sufficient for him that he has the place of the Moon
calculated for him in the ephemeris reduced from the Nautical or other
official Almanac. It is important, however, that he should know that
such problems exist.

Sir Isaac Newton was first led to the subject of Astronomy by his
thoroughness and scientific propensity. He studied Astrology, and
proceeded to the study of Astronomy the better to understand and deal
with the problems that the predictive science presented. For it is
to be observed that Astrology in his day was entirely in the hands
of astronomers, who calculated their own ephemerides and pursued
the higher methods of astrological calculation as presented in my
"Profnostic Astronomy." Kepler avowed himself to be convinced of
the truth of the science of Astrology, and showed himself to be a
competent critic as much by his understanding of the astronomical
problems involved as by his marvellous forecast of the rise and fall
of Wallenstein. Tycho, his colleague and collaborator, also a great
astronomical discoverer, was a professed Astrologer, and added to
his stipend by the calculation of horoscopes. Astrology is quite a
reputable study, and needs but to be emancipated from the service of
a horde of half-educated plagiarists and parasites in order to take
its place once more among subjects of serious consideration by the
learned. Astronomy is interesting, but to be made useful it must find
interpretation in terms of our daily life and common needs. It is in
this connection that Astrology has played Cinderella since the days of
official science. The day is not far off when it will come into its own.




CHAPTER VII

REVOLUTIONS, ECLIPSES, INGRESSES, ETC.


Beyond the various time measures and indicators mentioned in Section
IV, Chapter II, there are others which have a certain reputation among
astrological students. The chief of these, and one that has been in
vogue for many centuries, is the


Solar Revolution,

or Birthday Figure, as it is sometimes called. It consists in a map of
the heavens for the return of the Sun to the exact zodiacal position
that it held at birth, and this sidereal revolution is made the basis
of an annual forecast of the general trend of affairs in the life of
the subject. To find the time of the Sun's return to its own place
in the zodiac is, of course, a simple matter of proportion from the
ephemeris for the current year. This is effected by comparing the
radical or birthplace of the Sun with the longitude of the Sun in the
Ephemeris on the anniversary day, which will give the increment more
or less required to be equated. Then with this difference of the two
positions of the Sun (a) at birth and (b) at noon of the anniversary,
find the diurnal proportional logarithm and subtract from this the
logarithm for the Sun's motion in 24 hours. The result will be the
logarithm for the hours and minutes from Noon at which the Sun was in
the exact position it held at the birth. Thus you have the time of the
solar return, and all that is necessary is to erect a horoscope for
this time and set the planets in the figure.

Then, if the benefic planets are in elevation and the Lord or Ruler of
the Ascendant is well placed and aspected, there will be commensurate
results, and a beneficial year may be predicted; but if, on the
contrary, the malefic planets are elevated and the ruler of the
horoscope is badly aspected, the year ensuing will be fraught with many
troubles and vexatious events.

But inasmuch as the time-factor is here the return of the Sun to its
radical place, chief attention must be paid to the aspects of the Sun,
and conclusions agreeable to the nature of the afflicting planets or
those that favourably aspect the luminary may be made accordingly.

As regards the time at which events signified by the aspects may be
expected to transpire, I have found that they usually occur during
the transit of the Sun over the places of the planets in the annual
horoscope. Thus a person born in August may have the Sun in the annual
horoscope in square aspect to Saturn, the Sun being in Leo and Saturn
in Taurus. Then the evil signified by the aspect of Saturn to the Sun
would transpire about the date that the Sun passed the opposition of
Saturn in the sign Scorpio some time in November, or again in May of
the following year when the Sun was in conjunction with the place of
Saturn in the horoscope for the Solar return.

Events that are benefic in nature may be produced from the transit of
the Sun over the places of the benefics in the Solar figure, or over
the good aspects of the planet which in the annual horoscope gives
promise of benefit.

In similar manner the return of the Moon to its own place may be taken
as a monthly guide to the nature of ensuing events, but it is to be
observed that the Moon's place cannot be taken with the same degree
of accuracy as that of the Sun, owing to the varied acceleration of
the Moon from hour to hour. The Nautical Almanac gives this hourly
acceleration, so that by means of it the Moon's longitude can be
arrived at with great accuracy for any time of the day, but the cheaper
ephemerides do not contain more than the longitude for noon and
midnight. The student will find, however, that the general purposes
of a Lunar horoscope may be served with sufficient accuracy from this
source if chief regard be had to the aspects of the Moon at its return
and not to the mundane positions of the planets.

Arguing from analogy, one would suppose that a similar horoscope could
be made for the return of any of the planets to their radical places,
but until we have a popular publication in which the planets' places
are given with a greater degree of accuracy than at present, we cannot
pretend to indicate the true time of the revolutions of these bodies.

Another means of prognosis to which some astrologers have attached
considerable importance is what is known as


The Synodical Revolution.

This consists of a horoscope set for the time of the Moon's return to
the same distance from the Sun that it held at birth, which distance is
called the elongation. This measure is based upon the relative motions
of the Sun and Moon in the zodiac after birth. Thus if the mean motion
of the Sun for one day be taken as 59´ and that of the Moon as 13° 11´,
then the mean elongation of the Moon will be 12° 12´. But the Sun and
Moon are both subject to a variation from the mean motion, and thus the
elongation of the Moon is an inconstant quantity. The only means of
effecting the calculation, therefore, is by reference to the ephemeris
for the year of birth. Then, having the Moon's radical elongation, the
successive dates at which this elongation is repeated are to be noted,
and each of them is accounted as one year of life. Thus for the 20th
year of life one must count 19 synods or conjunctions of the Sun and
Moon after birth, and thereafter proceed to fix the date after the last
synod at which the Moon's elongation is the same as that of birth. This
idea seems to give grounds for the ancient belief in effects attaching
to the Moon's age. For the Moon's age denotes the distance of the Moon
from the last conjunction with the Sun, and if a person was born on the
tenth day of the Moon, then every tenth day of the Moon in successive
revolutions will be of importance, since the Moon will be in the same
relations with the Sun as at birth. The aspects that the Moon bears
to the other celestial bodies at these times is held to be a guide to
the nature of succeeding events. But more attention is paid to such
horoscopes thus calculated wherein the Moon falls on the place of any
of the planets at birth.


Ingresses

are of two kinds, mundane and zodiacal. A mundane ingress is made when
a planet in the heavens comes to the cusp of one of the Houses in
the horoscope of birth--that is to say, to the degree of the zodiac
which held the cusp of such House. Thus if the 8th degree of the sign
Aquarius were on the cusp of the 2nd House of the horoscope and Saturn
in the heavens made transit of that degree of the zodiac, then the
Ingress of Saturn to the 2nd House would be effected and would be
followed by a period of considerable financial stress. Similarly with
other planets in the horoscope. Each will make its periodical transit
through the several Houses of the horoscope of birth, and these will be
attended by events in terms of the nature of the planet, the House it
transits and its affections at birth.

Zodiacal ingresses are those that are made by the planets into the
signs of the zodiac successively, and it is held that a change in the
trend of affairs will take place in that department of the life ruled
by the House wherein that sign is placed at birth. This, however,
appears to be an extension of the former kind of ingress, and should be
taken with some reserve. Certainly it will be found that very marked
effects are due to the transits of the planets through the Houses of
the horoscope, and if the aspects of these planets in the ephemeris
are taken into account, it will be found that a very accurate basis
for a forecast of the various incidents of individual life is thereby
afforded.

In this connection the periodical synods of the planets should be
observed, for it is evident that if we ascribe an influence to the
transit of Saturn we must set a still more important value upon the
transit of that planet when in conjunction or opposition with any
other body in the heavens. Thus the planets Mars and Saturn form
their conjunctions in successive signs after an interval of about two
years, during which period it may be said that the effects of the
last conjunction are in play. Thus Saturn and Mars formed their last
conjunction in August, 1911, in the sign Taurus, and, according to
the position of that sign in various horoscopes, effects more or less
detrimental and disturbing would be experienced during the course of
two years after that date.

Jupiter's period of 12 years will be watched with interest by those who
are studying the effects due to its action, for it passes through one
sign or one House every year on an average, and therefore constitutes
a good chronocrator or time-marker. But Jupiter can effect little for
good if at the time of its transit it is afflicted in the heavens by
the adverse aspect or conjunction of another planet. Similarly, Saturn
or Uranus or Neptune has to be judged according to its condition and
aspects at the time of transit or ingress.


Eclipses,

whether of the Sun or Moon, are significant of evil according to their
positions and aspects in the horoscope. For if an eclipse of the Sun
happens it will afflict male members of the family, and an eclipse of
the Moon will denote evil to female members. Eclipses falling in the
sign occupying the 10th or 4th Houses will afflict the parents, and
those which fall in the 3rd House will similarly affect collateral
relatives, such as brothers and sisters, according to the sex indicated.

The effects of eclipses last for eighteen months, and will be great or
small according to the magnitude of the eclipse and considerations due
to aspects. When falling on the places of benefic planets or those well
aspected in the horoscope, the eclipse will portend good arising out of
some catastrophe or bereavement. But when falling on the places of the
malefics, or on places in the horoscope that are badly aspected by the
planets at birth, they portend nothing but evil.

Falling in other parts of the figure, they are not of such
significance, but generally it may be said that eclipses have a
detrimental effect on such affairs as are governed by the House wherein
the eclipse falls.

It has been said that unless an eclipse is visible in that part of
the world where the subject was born, it will have no effect upon his
health or fortunes. But this cannot be the case, for then those planets
that are beneath the horizon at the time of birth could with equal
reason be exempt from any share in our consideration, whereas, on the
contrary, we know full well that in whatever part of the circle the
planets may be situated at the moment of birth they will affect the
life and fortunes in equal degree, but especially such department of
the life as may be ruled by the House a planet occupies.

The following is a list of the visible eclipses that will be witnessed
in Great Britain during the next ten years:

    1914.--12th March, Moon eclipsed in the third hour of the morning,
    nearly total.

    21st August, the Sun eclipsed about noon, two-thirds of the disc
    eclipsed. Total in Sweden and Norway.

    1916.--9th January, Moon sets in contact with the shadow.

    3rd February, the Sun sets about half eclipsed. Total across the
    Atlantic.

    15th July, Moon eclipsed about three-quarters of its disc in the
    fifth hour of the morning.

    1917.--8th January, Moon eclipsed in the eighth hour of the
    morning, just before sunrise. Total.

    4th July, Moon totally eclipsed in the eleventh hour of the evening.

    28th December, Moon begins to be eclipsed just before setting.

    1919.--7th November, in the twelfth hour at night the Moon is
    partially eclipsed.

    22nd November, the Sun has one-fifth of its disc obscured near
    sunset. Annular in the South Atlantic.

    1920.--3rd May, Moon totally eclipsed in the second hour of the
    morning.

    10th November, Sun sets half eclipsed.

    1921.--8th April, in the ninth hour of the morning the Sun is
    eclipsed, about five-sixths of the disc being obscured. Annular
    eclipse in the north.

    16th October, the Moon has five-sixths of its disc overshadowed at
    eleventh hour of the evening.

    1922.--28th March, Sun eclipsed in the third hour of the afternoon,
    about one-sixth being obscured. Annular in Africa.

The years 1805 and 1917 are great eclipse years, for in both those
years there are no less than seven eclipses. From like causes we argue
like effects, and therefore we may anticipate a great convulsion in the
political world during the year 1917 and thereafter. At that time Mars
and Saturn will form their conjunction in the sign Leo together with
Neptune, and these successive conjunctions of the three major planets
cannot fail to produce great mutations, more especially in those
countries that are ruled by the sign Leo.

                               * * * * *

So far as individual horoscopes are concerned the effects of these
conjunctions and the eclipses which fall in the sign Capricornus and
Cancer must be judged by the particular Houses of the horoscopes in
which they occur. The general effects due to any eclipse or conjunction
of the larger planets are distributed and find their expression through
individual horoscopes, the influence filtrating as it were through a
variety of channels for the ultimate purpose of human evolution and
government.

                               * * * * *

Thus by many lines of evidence the patient student may confirm his
belief in the influence of the stars in human life, which involves
the yet higher concept of the government of humanity by the greater
Intelligences according to preordained laws, divine in their origin and
cosmical in their expression. To this concept as a final expression
of faith and of scientific experience we must eventually submit our
beliefs and opinions, and haply our willing compliance.

works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
